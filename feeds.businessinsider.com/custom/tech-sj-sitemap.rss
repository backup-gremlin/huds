We&#39;ve compiled everything you need to know about where to watch the Liberty vs. Lynx, including cable and streaming options.</p><p>Game 2 tied up the series this weekend and saw the Liberty win 80-66. It was a stark contrast from Game 1, wherein the teams went into overtime, and the Lynx ultimately squeaked out a 95-93 win. The Liberty are vying for their first-ever Championship win, while the Lynx hope to add a fifth chip to their legacy, so the stakes are high for both teams.

It&#39;s been several years since Amazon’s last e-reader update, so this long-awaited announcement is full of exciting new features that readers will love.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73736-20&amp;h=2c2e155766f034609b2d31a8f0e8d5009cc6922af5ab9c8189c857b0a3730d79&amp;postID=67101329e5b54083005af225&amp;postSlug=guides%2Ftech%2Famazon-kindle-colorsoft-release-date-features-specs&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CN3XR57P" data-autoaffiliated="true">Kindle Colorsoft</a> is the brand’s most exciting new addition, finally bringing a color-display option to the Kindle collection.

The latter two are available now, while the Colorsoft and Scribe are up for preorder.</p><p>I’ve broken down full details on each new Kindle below, plus how they improve upon their predecessors.</p><h2 id="976f16ba-451d-4010-8c2d-94522ac6c997" data-toc-id="976f16ba-451d-4010-8c2d-94522ac6c997" data-toc-label="Kindle Colorsoft"><strong>Kindle Colorsoft</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/671015cd6ac7b701e7cc9c25?format=jpeg" height="1200" width="1600" charset="" alt="amazon kindle colorsoft showing a graphic novel page while being used in a plane"/><figcaption>The Amazon Colorsoft offers a vivid color display, perfect for reading graphic novels.<p class="copyright">Amazon</p></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon’s first foray into color e-readers is called the Kindle Colorsoft, a model boasting the same performance readers love from Kindles, plus a paper-like color screen. It’s not the first of its kind &mdash; <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73736-20&amp;h=9353ebccf866dcbd39504969f83974bc3b45d4c958d9dc0d6f7339f1178d3079&amp;postID=67101329e5b54083005af225&amp;postSlug=guides%2Ftech%2Famazon-kindle-colorsoft-release-date-features-specs&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fcollections%2Fereaders" data-autoaffiliated="true">Kobo offers two of its own devices in Colour variants</a> &mdash; but it is unique in its display-enhancing features.</p><p>Amazon says that the Kindle Colorsoft’s LED lighting system and custom algorithms can emphasize color and brightness without washing out details. This has been a major downfall of competing color e-readers, so I’m curious to see if this system offers a noticeable improvement. It also promises smooth zoom functionality without pixelating images and even color style customization so that readers can opt between standard and vibrant.</p><p>One of the new device’s most exciting features for longtime Kindle users like me is its wireless charging. It still boasts the Kindle’s usual weeks of battery life, but now it can be juiced up without needing a pesky plug. It’s also waterproof.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" class="" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73736-20&amp;h=2c2e155766f034609b2d31a8f0e8d5009cc6922af5ab9c8189c857b0a3730d79&amp;postID=67101329e5b54083005af225&amp;postSlug=guides%2Ftech%2Famazon-kindle-colorsoft-release-date-features-specs&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CN3XR57P" data-autoaffiliated="true">Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition</a> is available for preorder starting at $280. Amazon hasn’t announced any other versions of the Colorsoft, but the “Signature Edition” branding suggests a standard model may be available in the future, perhaps for less. The Kindle Colorsoft officially launches on October 30.</p><h2 id="39729c91-b8c6-4e6d-8c85-2f072ddbdb49" data-toc-id="39729c91-b8c6-4e6d-8c85-2f072ddbdb49" data-toc-label="Kindle Scribe"><strong>Kindle Scribe with redesigned display</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/671014d1a703186492835456?format=jpeg" height="1080" width="1440" charset="" alt="amazon kindle scribe with redesign 2024 showing active canvas being used by a person laying on a couch"/><figcaption>The Active Canvas feature allows for users to jot down notes in the middle of a page while the text adapts around it.<p class="copyright">Amazon</p></figcaption></figure><p>The new Kindle Scribe seeks to add even more smart features to the brand’s writable e-reader. Its display has been redesigned with white borders to give a wider page feel but maintains the same 300 ppi resolution and 10.2-inch size.</p><p>New capabilities include Active Canvas, which allows readers to write notes directly onto the page (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">a feature the first Kindle Scribe model sorely lacked</a>) while the text adapts to flow around it.</p><p>The redesigned Kindle Scribe also comes with a built-in AI-powered notebook, which can turn large quantities of notes into quick bulleted lists that are easy to share. Handwritten notes can also be converted into typed script font.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73736-20&amp;h=e8ca4aaf6d6c26ac971dd74cef5028a19930a416880d46a6506a2ba16aeff28b&amp;postID=67101329e5b54083005af225&amp;postSlug=guides%2Ftech%2Famazon-kindle-colorsoft-release-date-features-specs&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CZ9TDDN6" data-autoaffiliated="true">Kindle Scribe with redesigned display</a> is now available to preorder.

It promises even snappier performance with 25% faster page turns &mdash; a strong statement for what was already one of the smoothest performing e-readers on the market.</p><p>In addition, the new Paperwhite offers the highest contrast ratio of any Kindle, so images and text should be even easier to see on the page. Its screen is also slightly larger, now seven inches rather than 6.8, while the e-reader itself is also thinner. Opting for the pricier Signature Edition will also get you wireless charging capabilities.</p><p>The previous-generation Kindle Paperwhite has long been my pick for the <a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-kindle">best Kindle</a> overall, so I’m excited to see how this new model performs in hand.

The new 11th-generation version maintains the same overall design and display size as the 2022 model but boasts faster page turns, a higher contrast ratio, and a 25% brighter front light. However, just like the previous generation, the new Kindle is not waterproof, and it lacks the adjustable warm light that other Kindles have.</p><p>The new <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73736-20&amp;h=5b815f847b0b6fb324a9f3166d9217d0ab36e3ded67449861b6a30dc8f0e3f4b&amp;postID=67101329e5b54083005af225&amp;postSlug=guides%2Ftech%2Famazon-kindle-colorsoft-release-date-features-specs&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CNV9F72P" data-autoaffiliated="true">11th-generation Kindle</a> is available now, starting at $110.

Teens today value authenticity, and nothing is more authentic than real film photography.&nbsp;</p><p>The LomoChrome Metropolis brings back the feel of old-school disposable cameras, except this one is reloadable (a roll of film is preloaded). It also teaches the fundamentals of photography: Because film is finite, it forces one to think about composition.

A too-small grind can lead to over-extraction, which results in a bitter brew. So, while this machine will serve most home coffee brewers very well, we recommend upgrading to the Baratza Sette 270 if you plan on making espresso regularly.&nbsp;</p><p>Although many of its competitors feature ceramic burrs, the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biauto-8963-20&amp;h=c9ccc668dadde05ee0f658d2415475e4799be9b140e7b7de40dd9923c966606a&amp;postID=61b8efc6f2a36b1ac9f419ed&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fkitchen%2Fbest-coffee-grinder&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB007F183LK" data-autoaffiliated="true">Encore</a>&#39;s is made from stainless steel, making it significantly more durable.

This is where the Sette 270 shows what it&#39;s made of. While every machine up to this price point left us with at least 10 to 20 percent fine particles, the Sette 270 produced such a negligible amount of fines that not only could we not weigh them, we couldn&#39;t scrape enough together to transfer them from the basin to the scale.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6025a0a8b3c2a800183cc703?format=jpeg" height="1249" width="1666" charset="" alt="Baratza&#39;s Sette 270 on a tile countertop in front of a peach-colored wall."/><figcaption>This machine is easily programmable, with three adjustable timed settings, and it fits most if not any portafilter.<p class="copyright">Owen Burke/Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the Sette 270&nbsp;is an excellent choice if you&#39;re serious about espresso, or use a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/kitchen/best-stovetop-espresso-maker">moka pot</a> (which also requires particularly fine grounds), but it might be overkill for less-precise brewing methods.

Blade grinders work similarly to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/kitchen/best-blenders">best blenders</a>, pulverizing coffee beans with a propeller-like blade attached to a motor. You won&#39;t get consistent results, but you will always get coffee without breaking the bank.</p><p><strong>Grind consistency:</strong> The most important factor when determining the quality of the best coffee grinder is consistency. In the case of espresso, the aim was 250-500 micrometers. For French press grounds, we shot for between 600 and 1100 micrometers. Keep in mind, though, that these are just general suggestions, and look for uniformity of particles above all.</p><p><strong>Espresso compatibility: </strong>While the ability to produce consistent, uniform grounds in the 250-500 micrometer range is the most essential coffee grinder requirement for making espresso, it&#39;s not the only factor we considered. Having a portafilter holder and a programmable interface also streamline the espresso brewing process, and we made sure to note machines with these features.&nbsp;</p><hr/><h2 id="d4511f4f-fac2-42ca-bf7d-274cb2729605" data-toc-id="d4511f4f-fac2-42ca-bf7d-274cb2729605" data-toc-label="How we test">How we test coffee grinders</h2><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e95fea7b3b0920d0731b084?format=jpeg" height="900" width="1200" charset="" alt="Coffee grounds from the Hario Skerton on a bamboo cutting board.

We then measured the grounds with a set of Kruve sifters &mdash; a series of stacked screens that separate coffee grounds at your determined grind size from any outliers &mdash; to see how many fine particles and boulders were left behind after each grind. Once we achieved the best yield of a target size, we repeated the process to check for consistent results.</p><p><strong>Programming:</strong> We noted whether or not you could program your own settings, and tested this function on each machine that offered it, docking points for grinders that made the process overly complicated.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Settings:</strong> We recorded the number of settings on every machine, and tested to see how each grinder performed on several of those settings, noting accuracy, consistency, and speed. Espresso is the most demanding grind size, and you&#39;ll need a machine with stainless steel burrs and at least 40 settings. Generally, we found that the brands&#39; recommended settings were often off-target, so we included our own additional suggestions for each machine.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Noise:</strong> We measured noise levels with a decibel meter, but ultimately this didn&#39;t factor too much into our final rankings. Some of the best burr grinders also happened to be the noisiest, but it&#39;s an inconvenience we can live with for quality coffee.</p><hr/><h2 id="48d36dbf-bc5f-45fc-b378-4a8e683554b2" data-toc-id="48d36dbf-bc5f-45fc-b378-4a8e683554b2" data-toc-label="FAQs">Coffee grinder FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">What is the best size to grind coffee?</h3><p class="faq-answer">To decide on grind size ranges for particular brewing methods, we consulted experts, including Dan Kehn of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.home-barista.com/">Home-Barista.com</a>, Sum Ngai of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://coffeeprojectny.com/">Coffee Project NY</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biauto-8963-20&amp;h=6322353ac8dec05c35b723fcde7101ae9134e2927f589ead09575f69cbebb4d3&amp;postID=61b8efc6f2a36b1ac9f419ed&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fkitchen%2Fbest-coffee-grinder&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kruveinc.com%2Fpages%2Fbrew-guide" data-autoaffiliated="true">Kruve&#39;s grind size guide</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biauto-8963-20&amp;h=b7745f0cc79b1e80dd28f4f1eb3bb985763d49133dbf6215facc820e71620c40&amp;postID=61b8efc6f2a36b1ac9f419ed&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fkitchen%2Fbest-coffee-grinder&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCraft-Science-Coffee-Britta-Folmer%2Fdp%2F012803520X%2Fref%3Dasc_df_012803520X%2F%3Ftag%3Dhyprod-20%26linkCode%3Ddf0%26hvadid%3D312091458201%26hvpos%3D%26hvnetw%3Dg%26hvrand%3D14313770195511906333%26hvpone%3D%26hvptwo%3D%26hvqmt%3D%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvdvcmdl%3D%26hvlocint%3D%26hvlocphy%3D1022762%26hvtargid%3Dpla-482831535564%26psc%3D1%26tag%3D%26ref%3D%26adgrpid%3D63669393113%26hvpone%3D%26hvptwo%3D%26hvadid%3D312091458201%26hvpos%3D%26hvnetw%3Dg%26hvrand%3D14313770195511906333%26hvqmt%3D%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvdvcmdl%3D%26hvlocint%3D%26hvlocphy%3D1022762%26hvtargid%3Dpla-482831535564" data-autoaffiliated="true">The Craft and Science of Coffee</a>.

Blade grinders work similarly to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/kitchen/best-blenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best blenders</a>, pulverizing coffee beans with a propeller-like blade attached to a motor. You won&#39;t get consistent results, but you will always get coffee without breaking the bank.</p><p><strong>Grind consistency:</strong> The most important factor when determining the quality of the best coffee grinder is consistency. In the case of espresso, the aim was 250-500 micrometers. For French press grounds, we shot for between 600 and 1100 micrometers. Keep in mind, though, that these are just general suggestions, and look for uniformity of particles above all.</p><p><strong>Espresso compatibility: </strong>While the ability to produce consistent, uniform grounds in the 250-500 micrometer range is the most essential coffee grinder requirement for making espresso, it&#39;s not the only factor we considered. Having a portafilter holder and a programmable interface also streamline the espresso brewing process, and we made sure to note machines with these features.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">How we test coffee grinders<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e95fea7b3b0920d0731b084?format=jpeg" height="900" width="1200" charset="" alt="Coffee grounds from the Hario Skerton on a bamboo cutting board.

We then measured the grounds with a set of Kruve sifters &mdash; a series of stacked screens that separate coffee grounds at your determined grind size from any outliers &mdash; to see how many fine particles and boulders were left behind after each grind. Once we achieved the best yield of a target size, we repeated the process to check for consistent results.</p><p><strong>Programming:</strong> We noted whether or not you could program your own settings, and tested this function on each machine that offered it, docking points for grinders that made the process overly complicated.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Settings:</strong> We recorded the number of settings on every machine, and tested to see how each grinder performed on several of those settings, noting accuracy, consistency, and speed. Espresso is the most demanding grind size, and you&#39;ll need a machine with stainless steel burrs and at least 40 settings. Generally, we found that the brands&#39; recommended settings were often off-target, so we included our own additional suggestions for each machine.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Noise:</strong> We measured noise levels with a decibel meter, but ultimately this didn&#39;t factor too much into our final rankings.

You should easily get 10 years out of a good coffee grinder, and much longer out of manual ones.</p><hr/><h3 class="faq-question">How do manual coffee grinders work?&nbsp;</h3><p class="faq-answer">Manual coffee grinders work just like the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/kitchen/best-pepper-mill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best pepper mills</a>. The finer-tuned the burr is, the more dynamic your grind size can be.</p></div><div class="slide">Glossary<p><strong>Blade (grinder): </strong>A grinder that works like a blender or a propeller, employing a set of blades attached to a motor.</p><p><strong>Boulders: </strong>Large grounds that are undesirable because they will under-extract and leave coffee watery.</p><p><strong>Burr (grinder): </strong>A mill, usually made of ceramic or steel. It consists of a rough-edged pair of abrasive surfaces, one a disc-like shape, the other forming a ring around the first.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Basin: </strong>The container into which the grounds fall.</p><p><strong>Fines: </strong>Small grounds almost dust-like in size, these are too small to brew as they&#39;ll be over-extracted and leave coffee tasting bitter.</p><p><strong>Hopper: </strong>The basin that stores the beans in the top of a burr grinder, ahead of grinding. You&#39;ll usually have to remove this to access, clean, and replace burrs.</p><p><strong>Micrometers: </strong>The standard unit of measurement for coffee grounds (.001 millimeters).</p><p><strong>(Grounds) Retention: </strong>The amount of grounds left trapped in the machine and/or burrs after grinding.</p></div></div><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/kitchen/best-coffee-grinder">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

It&#39;s made from long-staple Turkish cotton, which is exceptionally durable, and it has a 400 GSM (grams per square meter, a measure of fabric weight).

On the inside, it is lined with absorbent terry cloth so that you can wear it right out of the shower. But on the outside, it&#39;s plush like a really soft blanket.

    <p>If you tend to wake up sweaty or you like to cool down after a hot shower, slipping into this kimono-style robe feels like a breath of fresh air. At first touch, the fabric is cool and slippery. It looks like any other poly blend, but it&#39;s made from a combination of eucalyptus fibers and elastane, which is smoother than silk, lighter than linen, and more moisture-wicking than cotton.<br/><br/>I tested this robe alongside the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/style/best-cooling-pajamas">best cooling pajamas</a>, and it did its job of regulating my body temperature. Besides that, though, I recommend this robe because of how soft and lightweight it feels against my skin.

If you&#39;re not a fan of the rumpled look but still like the feel of linen, the robe is available in three darker shades (gray, navy, and black) that partially camouflage the wrinkles. It&#39;s also best to take the robe out of the dryer while it&#39;s still a little damp, so you can smooth out unwanted wrinkles by hand.</p><h2 id="f3bacf9a-80ef-434a-9cc5-75a1ca3abe38" data-toc-id="f3bacf9a-80ef-434a-9cc5-75a1ca3abe38">Best silk: Kim+Ono Kiku Kimono</h2><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fda80e2c910a400192e7f09?format=jpeg" height="600" width="800" charset="" alt="5 kim + ono slide"/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Connie Chen/Insider</p></figcaption></figure>

Just keep in mind that all of Kim + Ono&#39;s designs are dry clean only, and the silk creases and wrinkles easily; you&#39;ll need to steam or iron your robe on the warm setting to maintain its sleek, pristine appearance.</p><p>After I stopped admiring the robe to actually put it on, it felt very cool, glossy, and slippery. In addition to an exterior waist tie, there&#39;s a thin interior waist tie to help keep everything secure. The robe only comes in one size, and on me, it fell all the way to my ankles.

It will cost you an extra $10, but it&#39;s the perfect touch if you&#39;re giving this as a present.

Public Red also uses flatlock seams for this tee in which they butt together the fabric ends and stitch them so there are no rough edges (a practice more common to outdoor gear) for durability, a sleeker design, and extra comfort without chafing. The tee comes in eight outstanding colors.<br/><br/>Read more in our full <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/style/public-rec-go-to-tee-review">Public Rec Go-To Tee review</a>.</p></div><div class="slide">Best workwear: Carhartt Loose Fit Heavyweight Short-sleeve Pocket T-shirt<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6400ec8c934c2c001802645b?format=jpeg" height="838" width="1118" charset="" alt="A person wearing the Carhartt loose-fit pocket tee."/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Carhartt</p></figcaption></figure><p>Long before the fashion world co-opted the style, the American heritage brand Carhartt was making hard-wearing workwear, and 100+ years on, it continues to excel at its trade. The brand introduced its loose-fit heavyweight short-sleeve pocket T-shirt back in 1992 and it continues to be a bestseller.</p><p>They make it from a durable but soft heavy-weight 100% cotton jersey cut for a looser fit so you don&#39;t feel constricted while you work. That being said, just because it&#39;s billed as a work shirt for men doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be for play too. And with 21 colors to choose from, everything from Pale Apricot to Brite Orange, you can let your wild side show if you want. The shirt also features a left-chest pocket with the iconic Carhartt patch logo and comes in a vast range of sizes.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">Best curved hem: Cuts Clothing AO Curve-Hem Tee<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6400ef61994ec300189417c6?format=jpeg" height="754" width="1005" charset="" alt="A person wearing the Cuts Clothing AO curve-hem tee."/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Cuts Clothing</p></figcaption></figure><p>Curved-hem tees offer certain advantages over the classic straight-hemmed style. They draw the eye upwards to emphasize the vertical for a slimmer appearance. The curved hem also elongates the leg so you appear taller. And in the name of practicality, it&#39;s easier to access your pants&#39; pockets with this type of tee.</p><p>California-based Cuts Clothing takes the curved hem style and elevates it with its AO Curve-Hem Tee. The brand uses a proprietary cotton/spandex/polyester blend fabric that&#39;s soft, stretchy, and wrinkle-resistant.</p><p>They also engineer the shirt to prevent shrinkage and retain its color. This top T-shirt for men comes in two different fits &mdash; signature, which is an athletic cut that&#39;s fitted around the chest and arms and tapers towards the waist, and classic, which is roomier &mdash; and 10 contemporary colors.</p></div><div class="slide">Best moisture-wicking: Nike Dri-FIT Primary Top<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/66bbae9b955b01c3294e3426?format=jpeg" height="900" width="1200" charset="" alt="model wearing grey athletic shirt against a white background"/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Dick&#39;s Sporting Goods</p></figcaption></figure><p>Since its founding in the 1960s, Nike has pushed boundaries with its innovative athletic gear. The Nike Dri-FIT Primary Top incorporates the brand&#39;s Dri-FIT technology, a unique polyester microfiber fabric that draws sweat away from the body to keep you cool and dry when you&#39;re working out.</p><p>Vent holes in the pits also help keep your body temperature regulated while you work out. The Nike Primary Top incorporates some sustainable elements (organic cotton and recycled polyester) but at only 10% of each of these materials, it&#39;s not the most eco-friendly shirt on the list, though at least a start.</p></div><div class="slide">Best oversized: Tomorrows Laundry Modern Pocket Tee<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/64020e43bf7e0e001b795122?format=jpeg" height="556" width="741" charset="" alt="A person wearing a Tomorrows Laundry Modern Pocket Tee."/><figcaption><p class="copyright">Tomorrows Laundry</p></figcaption></figure><p>Tomorrow&#39;s Laundry is a young subscription box service for lovers of high-quality T-shirts for men and other basics.

The tees start at $55, but with the plan, you save about 35% on all orders, and the shipping&#39;s free.</p><p>The brand&#39;s Modern Pocket Tee is a handsome oversized T-shirt (1.5 inches longer than the standard) that&#39;s cut for a modern boxy fit and features a single chest pocket. A high stitch count for longer life, sustainable production practices, and ultra-touchable cotton fabric from Peru that comes in some unusual colors make this the perfect oversized tee. <br/><br/>Read more from Amir Ismael on the brand&#39;s T-shirts in our full <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/style/tomorrows-laundry-clothing-subscription-review"><strong>Tomorrows Laundry review</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">How we considered and tested men&#39;s T-shirts<p>Some of the main considerations for men&#39;s T-shirts include the quality of the materials used, the overall cut and shape of the shirt, and the price.

Not only does it have top-tier cleaning abilities, but it&#39;s also incredibly well-designed, with a self-emptying base, storage for all its attachments, and a surprisingly effective powered mopping module. It might be more pricey than other cordless vacuums, but I think it&#39;s worth every penny if you&#39;re looking for a versatile and powerful cleaning tool. Here&#39;s everything I love about it.</span></p><h2 id="c38b36d6-a6f3-49be-843a-dadb0a2a0fd3" data-toc-id="c38b36d6-a6f3-49be-843a-dadb0a2a0fd3"><span>Setup and Design</span></h2><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6710021c3f2165d716e21fa6?format=jpeg" height="3456" width="5184" charset="" alt="the lg cordzero at its dock "/><figcaption>The freestanding auto-empty base is one of the vacuum&#39;s biggest selling points, and neatly stores all of the accessories together. <p class="copyright">Camryn Rabideau/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p><span>The LG CordZero All-in-One arrives in a fairly large box, as its base doesn&#39;t break down like other vacuums. I had to consult the vacuum&#39;s manual while setting it up, as there were quite a few pieces included, and I wasn&#39;t sure where everything was supposed to go. However, once everything was assembled, I quickly came to appreciate this cordless vacuum&#39;s design, which has many useful features.</span></p><p><span>Weighing about seven pounds, it&#39;s not the lightest model I&#39;ve ever used, but this cordless vacuum is one of the most well-balanced. It doesn&#39;t feel top-heavy at all, and I love that you can adjust the height of the stick to a comfortable length so you&#39;re not hunched over while cleaning. (Just keep in mind that you&#39;ll have to shrink it back down before putting it on the dock.) The power buttons are located on the back of the vacuum&#39;s handle, and there are + and &ndash; buttons to increase or decrease the suction power between the three available settings. The vacuum also comes with a variety of attachments, including a crevice tool, a combination tool, a powered pet tool for upholstery, and a powered mopping attachment.</span></p><p><span>The vacuum is also wifi-equipped to connect to LG&#39;s ThinQ app. It doesn&#39;t add much functionality, in my opinion. It essentially shows you usage data and the battery percentage, and it&#39;s not necessary to use it to operate the vacuum.</span></p><p><span>This vacuum comes with a freestanding base, and in my opinion, it&#39;s one of the biggest selling points of the product. The base has a sleek design, but it&#39;s actually packed full of useful features. If you lift the top lid, there&#39;s a compartment that stores and charges the vacuum&#39;s backup battery, and there are hidden doors on both sides of the base that house storage compartments for all the vacuum&#39;s attachments. There&#39;s even a hook on the side of the base where you can hang the mopping module for easy access. I absolutely love that the brand makes it easy to keep all the attachments together&mdash;a nice change from brands like Dyson, where you&#39;re often forced to find storage for the vacuum&#39;s different tools.</span></p><h2 id="0140b4b6-3089-4eeb-9988-5ee5c3e9634c" data-toc-id="0140b4b6-3089-4eeb-9988-5ee5c3e9634c"><span>Our review of the LG CordZero All-in-One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum</span></h2><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6710021c3f2165d716e21fa8?format=jpeg" height="3456" width="5184" charset="" alt="hand holding the top of a vacuum"/><figcaption>The vacuum is comfortable to hold while cleaning, and the plus and minus buttons make it easy to toggle between settings. <p class="copyright">Camryn Rabideau/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p><span>I tested the LG CordZero All-in-One Vacuum at my home for more than two months, and it had its work cut out for it. Not only do I share my 2,000-square-foot home with two long-haired dogs and a rambunctious cat, but we live on a farm, meaning dirt, grass, and other debris are always tracked into the house. Only the most powerful vacuums can keep up with my cleaning needs, and cordless models often fall short of my expectations.</span></p><p><span>However, that wasn&#39;t the case with the LG CordZero. This vacuum impressed me with its overall design and cleaning performance, and it has several convenient features that I think make it worth the higher price point.</span></p><h3 id="5a62cc09-945c-47b8-b35e-568d47cdd5fe" data-toc-id="5a62cc09-945c-47b8-b35e-568d47cdd5fe"><span>Cleaning Performance</span></h3><p><span>I&#39;ve personally tested more than a dozen different cordless vacuums, and the LG CordZero All-in-One is one of the best in terms of cleaning performance. It stands out from the rest thanks to its powerful suction, which maxes out at 265 air watts, and its well-designed floorhead. The main attachment, called the Dual Floor Max Nozzle, has two brushrolls &mdash; one with stiff bristles to dig into carpeting and a second fuzzy brushroll that captures fine particles and prevents debris from being shot across the floor.</span></p><p><span>The dual-brushroll design works amazingly on both carpeting and hard floors, and in testing, it was almost always able to pick up 100% of debris in just one or two passes, including everything from small particles like coffee grounds to larger pieces of cereal and clumps of dog hair. Plus, the brushroll doesn&#39;t get tangled with long strands of hair &mdash; useful if you have several pets like me.</span></p><p><span>Because I have so many pets, I particularly liked this vacuum&#39;s motorized pet attachment, which I used regularly to clean hair off my sofas. Its motorized brushroll picks up pet hair (and human hair) quickly, and the vacuum is lightweight and manageable when used as a handheld tool. The crevice and combination tools were also useful, but the pet tool definitely got the most mileage in my household.</span></p><p><span>But that&#39;s not all! This particular LG model comes with a powered mopping attachment that essentially turns the vacuum into a spray mop. The mop has a small reservoir that you fill up with water and cleaning solution, and when attached to the vacuum, its two circular mop pads rotate to scrub your floors. Plus, when you press the + button, the mop head sprays solution onto the floor for more powerful cleaning action.</span></p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6710021ca703186492832c97?format=jpeg" height="3456" width="5184" charset="" alt="the mopping attachment attaches to the auto empty base when not in use"/><figcaption>The powered mopping attachment neatly stores on the base when not in use, and is effective in scrubbing up dirt in just a few seconds. <p class="copyright">Camryn Rabideau/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p><span>I used the mopping attachment on a few occasions. First, I used it to clean up some cat vomit on my hardwood floors, then again to remove dirt left behind when a houseplant tipped over. While the mopping module does take a bit of effort to control &mdash; it tends to move across the floor on its own if not held steady &mdash; it was surprisingly effective for both tasks. It cleaned up both messes in just a few seconds, and it took less effort than using a regular spray mop.</span></p><h3 id="09f02af9-7720-4bc5-a291-072a1028341f" data-toc-id="09f02af9-7720-4bc5-a291-072a1028341f"><span>Battery Life</span></h3><p><span>LG claims that the All-in-One offers &#34;up to 200 minutes of fade-free power,&#34; but there&#39;s fine print you have to consider. This runtime estimation is on the lowest power setting </span><em><span>without</span></em><span> the Dual Floor Max Nozzle attached. As soon as you increase the suction or attach the motorized floorhead, the battery life drops quite a bit.</span></p><p><span>When we tested out the vacuum&#39;s battery life on the medium suction setting using the floorhead, it ran for around 15 minutes per battery. The vacuum comes with two interchangeable batteries, giving you around 30 minutes of total cleaning time &mdash; pretty average for stick vacuums, but also a far cry from the 200 minutes the brand advertises.</span></p><h3 id="a1b1e4eb-d9a0-41ba-b363-259647902c0b" data-toc-id="a1b1e4eb-d9a0-41ba-b363-259647902c0b"><span>Dust bin</span></h3><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6710021c3f2165d716e21fa7?format=jpeg" height="3456" width="5184" charset="" alt="a look at a dustbag inside of the lg clean station"/><figcaption>The sealed disposable dust bag limits contact with dust and debris and can hold up to 33.8 ounces. <p class="copyright">Camryn Rabideau/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p><span>This vacuum&#39;s onboard dust bin can hold up to 13.5 ounces of debris, and it has a handy &#34;Kompressor&#34; lever that lets you pack down the contents to make more room, allowing you to clean for longer. This is particularly useful when vacuuming pet hair, which tends to take up a lot of space in the dust bin.</span></p><p><span>While you can empty this vacuum&#39;s dustbin manually &mdash; there&#39;s a little button that hinges open the container &mdash; I typically use its self-emptying base instead. All you have to do is place the vacuum back on its dock, and after playing a little chime sound, it will suck all the debris out of the vacuum and into the base. The base contains a disposable vacuum bag that holds 33.8 ounces of debris, and when it fills up, there&#39;s an indicator light on top of the dock that lets you know a new bag is needed. The vacuum comes with four bags, and a three-pack of additional </span><a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biauto-56307-20&amp;h=bce77bde345263dbcc822391995b5bb61459d9c25ac6ed7e47fcf12f2bfd7690&amp;postID=670fe0a9434c477c2331af5d&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Flg-cordzero-all-in-one-cordless-vacuum-review&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fappliances-accessories%2Flg-aiot-bag" data-autoaffiliated="true"><span>replacement bags</span></a><span> costs $19.99.</span></p><p><span>In addition to being convenient, I found that this self-emptying system is great for keeping dirt and dust out of my home. When emptying other cordless vacuums into the trash can, debris often puffs up, allowing the particles to float back out into the room. With this system, all the dust and allergens are sucked right into the base and trapped in the vacuum bag, so the particles never have a chance to escape.</span></p><h3 id="4ad46ed2-0262-45a5-84f4-0894b28e7faa" data-toc-id="4ad46ed2-0262-45a5-84f4-0894b28e7faa"><span>Cleaning and Maintenance</span></h3><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/67100fc13f2165d716e24047?format=jpeg" height="3456" width="5184" charset="" alt="pulling out the filter from the lg base station"/><figcaption>LG recommends washing the filter monthly and provides easily accessible directions and graphics right on the base. <p class="copyright">Camryn Rabideau/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p><span>Because of its self-emptying design, which does a great job pulling the vast majority of dirt out of the dust bin, this cordless vacuum doesn&#39;t require nearly as much cleaning as other models. Even after several weeks of use, its dust bin was mostly dust-free. The mopping pads are really the only component that needs regular cleaning, and while hand-washing is recommended, I put them through the washing machine on a delicate cycle, and they came out as good as new.</span></p><p><span>The brand recommends a few maintenance steps to keep the vacuum working properly, specifically washing the vacuum&#39;s pre-filter and exhaust filters once a month. The brand also provides detailed instructions for cleaning each of the vacuum&#39;s attachments in case they ever get clogged or overly dirty.</span></p><h2 id="604fff2f-13b8-49e8-a346-48fac7871c1c" data-toc-id="604fff2f-13b8-49e8-a346-48fac7871c1c"><span>Cons to consider</span></h2><p><span>After several weeks of testing, the biggest downside of this cordless vacuum is definitely its battery life. I often went through both batteries while cleaning my home, and comparatively, other vacuums at this price point deliver longer runtimes. For this reason, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this model to anyone with a larger home.</span></p><p><span>The All-in-One also has a surprisingly short warranty period considering its price point. LG only offers a one-year warranty on the vacuum, though you can upgrade to a two- or three-year protection program if you purchase it directly from LG. However, these extended warranties cost $60.99 or $72.99, respectively. Considering the vacuum is pricey to begin with, I think a longer warranty should be included.</span></p><h2 id="7ed126c4-e8ba-4da3-903e-70b866b81466" data-toc-id="7ed126c4-e8ba-4da3-903e-70b866b81466"><span>What are your alternatives?</span></h2><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/65b7c200ac2de4f17ee5653e?format=jpeg" height="3024" width="4032" charset="" alt="The Dyson v15s Detect Submarine against a wall with the three floorheads"/><figcaption>The similarly priced Dyson v15s Detect Submarine includes a mopping attachment and two different floorheads for cleaning hard floors and carpets. <p class="copyright">Jaclyn Turner/ Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>The LG CordZero All-in-One (A949KTMS) is the <span>brand&#39;s top-of-the-line model, boasting the highest suction power and most features of all its cordless vacuums.

      <description>Sling and Fubo are two top live TV packages. But what is right for you, and which is better overall?</description>

While the two might seem similar at the outset, they notably vary in coverage and price, two of the most important factors when picking a streaming service.</p><p>We have tested both of these services extensively, watching both live and recorded content several times across both streamers. We&#39;ve also tested the service on multiple devices, including Samsung televisions, Amazon Fire TV Stick, iPhones, Android phones, iPads, and MacBooks.</p><p>We&#39;ll break down all of the necessary info to decide whether Sling or Fubo might be a better fit for you, including comparisons of price, channels, devices, DVR, and on-demand options, among other important specs. Ultimately, Sling vs. Fubo comes down to what you&#39;re looking for in a live streaming package, so we&#39;ll dig into the relative merits below.</p><h2 id="a2aae65d-ca5f-483c-a8d2-d35bd3a90662" data-toc-id="a2aae65d-ca5f-483c-a8d2-d35bd3a90662" data-toc-label="Prices">Prices</h2><p id="a2aae65d-ca5f-483c-a8d2-d35bd3a90662">Sling&#39;s base plans, Sling Orange and Sling Blue, cost $40/month each. The combo plan, Sling Orange + Blue, costs $55/month. Additional smaller channel packages are available as add-ons for each (or either) plan. <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73731-20&amp;h=8c110889c4deeb76bdb2d0e1d400295ded82bd046f5cd1555ca4397cb76ebb6d&amp;postID=66f2aadfd738168e48a5fca4&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fsling-vs-fubo&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fservice%2Fextras" data-autoaffiliated="true">Sling add-ons and extras</a> include the Entertainment Extra for $6/month, the Sports Extra for $11/month, and the Kids Extra for $6/month.</p><p id="a2aae65d-ca5f-483c-a8d2-d35bd3a90662">Fubo&#39;s base plan, Fubo Pro, costs $79.99/month. Fubo also offers an Elite with Sports Plus plan for $99.99/month and a Deluxe plan for $109.99/month. <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73731-20&amp;h=bd12fdb2d398c437aa37be59ee3f2f1ccfb48c8dc0439d4fc5bd69f90e51549f&amp;postID=66f2aadfd738168e48a5fca4&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fsling-vs-fubo&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fwelcome%2Fchannels" data-autoaffiliated="true">Fubo add-ons</a> include Sports Lite for $9.99/month, NBA League Pass for $16.99/month, and Fubo Extra for $7.99/month, among others.</p><p id="a2aae65d-ca5f-483c-a8d2-d35bd3a90662">Both Sling and Fubo also have plans for select international offerings. Fubo has Latino for $32.99/month, which carries specific Spanish-language channels, like TUDN, ESPN Deportes, and much more. <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73731-20&amp;h=1975230df101e1bbd553966752691cf5c2e0a04cf28b65659818ce01555d3b3a&amp;postID=66f2aadfd738168e48a5fca4&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fsling-vs-fubo&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Finternational%2Fdesi-tv%2Fhindi" data-autoaffiliated="true">Sling&#39;s Desi plans</a> range from $10-$45/month and cover a variety of Hindi shows and sports.</p><p id="a2aae65d-ca5f-483c-a8d2-d35bd3a90662">Another thing to keep in mind when comparing prices is how often and by how much each streaming service raises its rates. Fubo&#39;s prices have jumped more drastically over the past few years. In early 2020, Fubo&#39;s base package cost $54.99. At the time of writing (September 2024), this option is now $79.99. In that same 2020 time period, Sling Orange + Blue cost $45. Now, it costs $55.</p><h2 id="296f2bd8-6bb8-48b8-a095-2b12beb0fb35" data-toc-id="296f2bd8-6bb8-48b8-a095-2b12beb0fb35" data-toc-label="Channels">Channels</h2><p>Sling&#39;s Orange plan comes with 35 channels, while the Blue plan offers 43 channels. Several of these channels overlap between plans, so Sling Orange + Blue carries 46 in total. Orange carries ESPN, ESPN3, ESPN3, ESPN4K, and Disney Channel, among others. Blue offers FX, MSNBC, Bravo, FS1, USA, the NFL Network, and more. Both plans have CNN, AMC, TNT, and TBS, among others.</p><p>Sling has most of the essentials, although the availability of <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73731-20&amp;h=51e1eb43b4ded941b58e9a4b9e6cba183651926a906aac130cb679cba018e7e4&amp;postID=66f2aadfd738168e48a5fca4&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fsling-vs-fubo&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fhelp%2Fen%2Fsubscription-programming-questions%2Fchannels-programming%2Flocal-channels" data-autoaffiliated="true">local channels</a> (including NBC, ABC, and FOX) varies from region to region (and no Sling plans carry CBS). Local channels are pretty essential for news, sports, and network television series, but you can get these through an over-the-air antenna. <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73731-20&amp;h=ea492ae597050768425a9e3608b674d0f5ecbe4ae8e8e6ee527b53f1d91ddc2b&amp;postID=66f2aadfd738168e48a5fca4&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fsling-vs-fubo&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fsupported-devices%2Fairtv-mini" data-autoaffiliated="true">Sling will send you an HD antenna</a> for free (along with an AirTV device) if you prepay for three months of service.</p><p>Sling also offers several add-ons. Some of the most enticing extras include the Sports Extra, Entertainment Extra, and News Extra. The exact channel makeup varies depending on whether it&#39;s an add-on for the Blue or Orange plans, but Sports Extra offers the addition of NBA TV, MLB Network, and the Tennis Channel for both plans, among other extra networks. The same goes for the Entertainment Extra &mdash;&nbsp;which offers the Paramount Network, MTV, and Laff across both plans &mdash; in addition to other channels specific to each plan.</p><p>Fubo&#39;s Pro plan has 150+ channels, but the exact number varies from region to region and is often much more. Fubo was originally a sports-centric streaming service with a focus on soccer, so it carries most sports essentials, including ESPN and ESPN2. Fubo also offers robust local channel coverage, including ABC, NBC, FOX, The CW, <em>and</em> CBS.</p><p>However, Fubo is missing a few key channels &mdash; like AMC, CNN, TNT, TBS, and truTV &mdash; and there is no add-on that can grant access to them. While every live TV package is missing something, the omission of the Warner Bros. channels, especially TNT and TBS, are particularly notable gaps for a sports-centric live TV package since this rules out a number of NBA games for the upcoming season.</p><p>Fubo&#39;s other plans and add-ons can get subscribers well over 200 channels in total. The handiest and most affordable of the add-ons is Fubo Extra, which beefs up a subscription with over 50 extra channels, including ESPNU, NBA TV, MLB Network, and TeenNick, among other options. The service also offers other specific additional options centered on sports or news, but there is overlap between many add-ons.</p><h2 id="e6fe8957-b7ab-4e04-b72c-ea6db5486865" data-toc-id="e6fe8957-b7ab-4e04-b72c-ea6db5486865" data-toc-label="On-demand and DVR">On-demand and DVR</h2><p id="e6fe8957-b7ab-4e04-b72c-ea6db5486865">While Sling and Fubo might be best known for their live TV channels, both services also offer on-demand content. The on-demand content for both services varies from day to day, but it includes recent episodes of TV shows and notable sports events.</p><p id="802e2089-a1c4-4ca4-acd9-1d6c5223be97">Both Sling and Fubo also have ample DVR offerings, with most channels able to be recorded, although Fubo wins out on the amount of storage. Fubo comes with Unlimited Cloud DVR. Sling&#39;s base plans start with 50 hours of space, but you can upgrade to 200 hours by adding DVR Plus for an extra $5/month.</p><p id="802e2089-a1c4-4ca4-acd9-1d6c5223be97">Although Fubo is superior when it comes to storage, the actual DVR usability is a different story. The interface is easy enough to navigate, but fast-forwarding and rewinding recorded events often throws off the app to the point where you have to exit the recording and click back in to get it to start playing again. Usually, the recording will keep its place, but occasionally it starts over.</p><p id="802e2089-a1c4-4ca4-acd9-1d6c5223be97">Keeping a recording paused for longer than a few minutes will also sometimes cause it to have this issue. Often, when dealing with these problems, an error message will appear like the one below. The &#34;try again&#34; button often doesn&#39;t work, forcing you to exit the recording. This has not been an issue with Sling.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/66f9e161f44bdb4cfa37f764?format=jpeg" height="3024" width="4032" charset="" alt="A TV displaying a Fubo error message that reads: &#34;We&#39;re unable to play this content&#34;"/><figcaption>This Fubo error message pops up sometimes when fast-forwarding or rewinding recorded content.<p class="copyright">Lillian Brown/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="b51585c0-5fd0-429d-9d3c-935d2b26d7bd" data-toc-id="b51585c0-5fd0-429d-9d3c-935d2b26d7bd" data-toc-label="Display, interface, and user-friendliness">Display, interface, and user-friendliness</h2><p id="b51585c0-5fd0-429d-9d3c-935d2b26d7bd">The TV guide display for both services mimics that of a traditional cable package. Fubo&#39;s TV guide is a little bit easier to navigate, namely because it has both the channel logo and a thumbnail image for the current programming. So, if you&#39;re scrolling through the TV guide in a hurry, it&#39;s a little bit easier to spot your desired programming on Fubo. Overall, both are intuitive and easy to adjust to, especially if you&#39;re a recent cord-cutting convert from cable.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/66fb10ec7518aa57bc9f79eb?format=jpeg" height="1396" width="2848" charset="" alt="The TV guide for the streaming service Fubo"/><figcaption>Fubo&#39;s TV guide.<p class="copyright">Fubo; Lillian Brown/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/66fb112af44bdb4cfa385600?format=jpeg" height="1360" width="2846" charset="" alt="The Sling TV guide."/><figcaption>Sling&#39;s TV guide.<p class="copyright">Sling; Lillian Brown/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p id="b51585c0-5fd0-429d-9d3c-935d2b26d7bd">The services offer similar shortcuts when you open the app or log in on your browser: Fubo lets you &#34;favorite&#34; a channel, and Sling allows you to &#34;heart&#34; it. Upon opening the app, they both prompt you with live programs you&#39;re likely to watch from channels you&#39;ve recently used.</p><h2 id="2583dc88-d777-41c6-a5c5-c9e0a591c29a" data-toc-id="2583dc88-d777-41c6-a5c5-c9e0a591c29a" data-toc-label="Devices">Devices</h2><p id="2583dc88-d777-41c6-a5c5-c9e0a591c29a">Fubo and Sling TV offer similarly broad compatibility across most major streaming devices. Specific compatible device models can be found on Fubo and Sling&#39;s websites. Neither streaming service can be played through PlayStation or Nintendo.</p><p id="2583dc88-d777-41c6-a5c5-c9e0a591c29a"><a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73731-20&amp;h=8c0d8ad1d7aa66aa7c845722e06655f310fdbffef4dc558beafa5ee56ae83851&amp;postID=66f2aadfd738168e48a5fca4&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fsling-vs-fubo&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fsupported-devices" data-autoaffiliated="true">Sling&#39;s supported devices</a> include all of the big hitters, like Amazon Fire and Echo Show, Samsung, Chromecast, Cox, AirTV, Google TV and Nest, LG, Roku, Tivo, Vizio, LG, Xfinity, Xbox, and both browser and app availability for Apple and Android products (including phones, TVs, and tablets).</p><p id="2583dc88-d777-41c6-a5c5-c9e0a591c29a"><a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73731-20&amp;h=c21401f0ddb5455f0cfa00805c66bcb21080f93fb61ae1d3708973f375d043eb&amp;postID=66f2aadfd738168e48a5fca4&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fsling-vs-fubo&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fwelcome%2Fapps" data-autoaffiliated="true">Fubo&#39;s list of compatible devices</a> has grown in recent years and has become comparable to Sling&#39;s, with availability across Amazon Fire TV, Hisense, LG, Roku, Vizio, Samsung, Chromecast, Xbox, and Apple and Android products (TVs, tablets, and phones), among others.</p><p id="2583dc88-d777-41c6-a5c5-c9e0a591c29a">When it comes to streaming on multiple devices, Fubo definitely wins out. Sling Orange allows for streaming on one device, Sling Blue permits two, and Sling Orange + Blue lets you stream on up to four devices. Fubo, on the other hand, lets you watch on up to 10 devices from within your home network.

Over the past half-year, we&#39;ve seen this offer range from anything from $10 to $25 off your first month.</p><p id="5fba467c-2bce-4b19-99fa-be0f8ede0c4c">Fubo offers a seven-day free trial. Recently, the streaming service also began offering $20 off your first month of service following the conclusion of the free trial period.</p><p id="5fba467c-2bce-4b19-99fa-be0f8ede0c4c">Neither Fubo nor Sling offers savings through annual plans since they don&#39;t have yearlong or long-term contracts, hence the appeal of month-to-month services. Sling, however, sometimes offers perks when prepaying for a few months (usually 2-3 months), especially when it comes to getting a <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73731-20&amp;h=ea492ae597050768425a9e3608b674d0f5ecbe4ae8e8e6ee527b53f1d91ddc2b&amp;postID=66f2aadfd738168e48a5fca4&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fsling-vs-fubo&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fsupported-devices%2Fairtv-mini" data-autoaffiliated="true">free AirTV device or HD Antenna</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73731-20&amp;h=126b9eaee1520afc6602a33cc1a72b41cbaae0f0dff437a564ff06ac208cb92d&amp;postID=66f2aadfd738168e48a5fca4&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fsling-vs-fubo&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Fdeals" data-autoaffiliated="true">Sling&#39;s deals page</a> has a full rundown of current offers, including the NFL season pass and discounts on streaming service add-ons, including Paramount+ with Showtime, AMC+, MGM+, and more.</p><h2 id="8b99a810-803c-4ac5-afff-1cb5f338c20d" data-toc-id="8b99a810-803c-4ac5-afff-1cb5f338c20d" data-toc-label="The bottom line">Sling vs. Fubo: The bottom line</h2><p id="8b99a810-803c-4ac5-afff-1cb5f338c20d">As mentioned above, Sling vs. Fubo ultimately comes down to what you&#39;re looking for in a streaming service. For a true cable replacement with tons of extra channels and easy-to-access local network offerings, Fubo has its merits. But if you&#39;re just looking to replace the essentials and fill in some gaps, Sling might be the better choice. Most people cut the cord because prices are getting out of hand and they feel like they&#39;re paying for a bunch of channels they don&#39;t need; Sling&#39;s specs take this into account.</p><p id="8b99a810-803c-4ac5-afff-1cb5f338c20d">Bogged down in the nitty gritty (DVR hours, number of channels, etc.), Fubo seems superior, but when it comes to practical use, function, and affordability, Sling wins out (as long as you&#39;re able to leverage Sling&#39;s antenna option and hone in on local channels, which are necessary parts of any TV package).</p><p id="8b99a810-803c-4ac5-afff-1cb5f338c20d"><em>For more information on prices and plans, you can check out the </em><a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73731-20&amp;h=1e3fb696bbdb86813884158ec2e9e64a5dc2a54ce1cba247f82c951a9c2e37b6&amp;postID=66f2aadfd738168e48a5fca4&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fsling-vs-fubo&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2F" data-autoaffiliated="true"><em>Sling TV</em></a><em> or </em><a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-73731-20&amp;h=76355f206120d3719ee719da06150539f45294a5bb7b5385620d56956cf29352&amp;postID=66f2aadfd738168e48a5fca4&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fsling-vs-fubo&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fubo.tv%2Fwelcome" data-autoaffiliated="true"><em>Fubo TV</em></a><em> websites.</em></p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/streaming/sling-vs-fubo">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

Made from hypoallergenic shredded memory foam, the Coop pillow has an adjustable fill that lets you customize it to the perfect loft for your sleep preferences. Other thoughtful features like a washable cover, 5-year warranty, and 100-night trial make it our top recommendation.&nbsp;</p><p>When you open the box, a bright yellow insert walks you through how to customize the pillow and suggests how much fill to add or remove (it&#39;s more than you think) based on your preferred sleeping position. While the pillow arrives almost overfilled, it also comes with a half-pound bag of additional stuffing in case you need even more support.&nbsp;</p><p>I followed the package recommendations to remove about a third of the fill for back sleepers. The result felt deeply personalized, and it was very comfortable to sleep on with an outstanding balance of support and fluff.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/65e9e5c36080194819fd8b8d?format=jpeg" height="1249" width="1665" charset="" alt="The white Coop pillow sits on a bed with the logo text &#34;COOP&#34; and quilted design sewn on it."/><figcaption>The adjustable loft of the Coop Sleep Goods Original Pillow makes it the best option for most people.<p class="copyright">Lauren Savoie/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>I think most people will love the customization, especially if you prefer the springy feel of memory foam.</p><p>The brand has also released more adjustable shapes targeted for side and back sleepers and a body pillow, which tops our guide to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/home/best-body-pillow">best body pillows</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>One drawback?

Instead, these pillows are filled with hypoallergenic polyester gel fiber, similar to a down alternative in both feel and performance. Compared to denser materials like memory foam, the pillows stay relatively cool but stop short of actively cooling you.</p><p>While these pillows aren&#39;t adjustable, each pack comes with two pillows, so you can easily stack them to your desired comfort level.

While experts told us that down allergies are less common than we&#39;ve been made to believe, people with dust mite allergies may sleep easier with a hypoallergenic pillow. That&#39;s why, for this guide, we focused mostly on memory foam and down-alternative pillows.</p><p>For those who strongly prefer the feel of a down pillow, our guide to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/home/best-down-pillow">best down pillow</a> cover options across a number of styles and budgets.

We tried the mid-plush and think it&#39;s a great middle-of-the-road option if you&#39;re unsure what kind of pillow you like best. The mid has a dual chamber design with a feather core for support and is surrounded by fluffy down clusters at a ratio of 30% down to 70% feathers. Meanwhile, the firm also has a dual design but a ratio of 14% clusters and 86% feathers, ideal for side sleepers. The plush option is filled with 100% down clusters for the soft comfort stomach sleepers crave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The down compressed easily but bounced back up quickly and was easy to fluff up. This pillow had the most noticeable down smell of all the down pillows, but it did dissipate.

For side sleepers, this means bridging the gap between your ear and where your shoulder meets the mattress. But shoulder size and height can vary a lot from person to person, meaning one side sleeper might need a lofty pillow while another needs just a little lift.</p><p>The Coop pillow (our pick for best pillow overall) is ideal for side sleepers because it offers a lot of customization to help fill that gap. That&#39;s why we also named it the top overall pick in our guide to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/home/best-pillow-for-side-sleepers">best pillow for side sleepers</a>. But if you prefer the soft, buoyant feel of down alternative,&nbsp; you&#39;ll love the Casper Original Pillow.&nbsp;</p><p>Made from down-alternative hypoallergenic fill with a percale cotton shell, the Casper pillow feels like the soft, plush pillows in hotel rooms. A 2-inch gusset (the strip of fabric between seams that gives the pillow a more boxy shape) keeps the pillow lofted for the supportive lift that side sleepers require, but the plush fill still provides the &#34;sinking in&#34; sensation when you lay your head down.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/624f21dcfabc73001868d5d0?format=jpeg" height="1249" width="1666" charset="" alt="image of a casper pillow on a bed, best pillow of 2021"/><figcaption>The high loft of the Casper Original Pillow makes it a great choice for side sleepers, though back sleepers often enjoy it too.<p class="copyright">Lauren Savoie/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>Senior home editor Jaclyn Turner has slept on the Casper Original Pillow for over a year.

I love how my head sinks into this soft pillow, but it&#39;s still supportive enough to keep its shape all night long. When I wake up, the pillow looks just as plush as when I fell asleep.</p><p>I&#39;m a very active sleeper who likes to move around a lot in bed and take my bedding with me, so I love that the pillow is equally plush and comfortable from all sides and angles. It&#39;s still soft and supportive when I fold, scoop, or hug it throughout the night. It&#39;s dense but quickly goes back to its original shape. Finally, it&#39;s hypoallergenic, a must for allergy sufferers like myself.&nbsp;</p><p>Multiple stomach sleepers who tried the pillow as part of our testing found it too lofty, even with the inner core removed. Some side sleepers might also find the pillow not quite lofty enough; we think it&#39;s best for back sleepers and those who prefer a plusher, cooler feel than memory foam.&nbsp;</p><hr/><h2 id="fc6c7be9-ab75-4305-9791-b301699d797e" data-toc-id="fc6c7be9-ab75-4305-9791-b301699d797e" data-toc-label="Best for stomach sleepers">Best pillow for stomach sleepers</h2><p>Stomach sleepers generally require the least pillow support since their head and spine are already pretty close to alignment when lying on their stomach. Most stomach sleepers would benefit from a soft pillow with just a bit of loft, and for that, the Parachute Down-Alternative Pillow is the top choice.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the only pillow that received high marks for comfort from my husband, an avowed stomach sleeper who finds most pillows too lofty. The Parachute pillow elevates his head just enough to alleviate any neck strain, and the sateen cotton encasement keeps the pillow remarkably cool all night long, ideal for those like him who run hot.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fdcc7f2d366e60018098e00?format=jpeg" height="1251" width="1668" charset="" alt="Two parachute down pillows stacked on top of each other on a bed."/><figcaption>Parachute&#39;s Down-Alternative Pillows are soft and stackable; perfect for stomach sleepers and combo sleepers that like to layer their pillows.<p class="copyright">Lauren Savoie/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>We purchased four of these pillows in soft, and they were our mainstay before I started testing and evaluating pillows for this guide. They&#39;re also available in medium and firm variations. In many ways, this pillow hits all the marks for me: it stays cool, is incredibly soft and comfortable, and is hypoallergenic. But while my husband happily drifts asleep with one of these pillows tucked under his head, I (a back sleeper) need to stack two or three to get the loft I need to fall asleep comfortably.&nbsp;</p><p>While the fill is thin enough that the pillow easily folds over for some support if you occasionally flip to your side or back during the night, it doesn&#39;t provide enough for those who spend most of the night in those positions. The pillow won&#39;t offer much lift if you want to prop yourself up to read or watch TV while lounging in bed. Still, it&#39;s a great personal pillow for any stomach sleeper who has found other pillows too lofty.&nbsp;</p><hr/><h2 id="0b332335-53ce-4393-9edb-4eeb20a21200" data-toc-id="0b332335-53ce-4393-9edb-4eeb20a21200" data-toc-label="Best cooling">Best cooling pillow</h2><p>Whether you&#39;re a hot sleeper or battling heat waves, you&#39;ll never worry about having to flip to the cool side of the pillow when you select a pillow specifically designed to sleep cool and comfortable.

As someone who spends more than 100 nights away from home in an average year, I know the pleasure of sinking into a plush, perfectly squishy hotel pillow. Since I&#39;m also a pillow reviewer, I make it a habit to investigate the tags on any hotel pillows I find particularly comfortable. More often than not, it turns out to be The Marriott Pillow.</p><p>Fortunately, Marriott allows you to buy the exact pillows it uses in its rooms for your home bedroom. To ensure the pillows live up to their hotel counterparts, I tested both a king-size and standard-size model at home. I&#39;m happy to report that they&#39;re identical in feel and comfort to the ones I&#39;ve experienced in Marriott&#39;s hotels.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/65c117996fcb546d2d4c283e?format=jpeg" height="4284" width="5712" charset="" alt="Two Marriott Pillows without cases on a bed"/><figcaption>Marriott&#39;s pillow is just as comfortable as what you&#39;ll experience in its hotels, though side and back sleepers may need to double up to get enough support.<p class="copyright">Lauren Savoie/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>These pillows are incredibly plush and fluffy. The combination of down and lyocell fill results in a squishy feel that is soft without bottoming out. As a back and sometimes side sleeper, I have to double up on these pillows to get the right amount of support. However, my stomach-sleeping husband has completely commandeered these pillows, replacing our Parachute pillows as his personal pillow. Remember that you&#39;ll need to fluff these pillows daily for best results; they compact a bit during the night. Marriott also only offers a 30-day return policy, which is less than many of our other picks.</p><hr/><hr/><h2 id="42fa3855-2996-42f1-96da-9016a5ee39a2" data-toc-id="42fa3855-2996-42f1-96da-9016a5ee39a2" data-toc-label="Other pillows we recommend">Other pillows we recommend</h2><h3 id="99ed19dd-bb44-4fc9-a6c0-451400df0714" data-toc-id="99ed19dd-bb44-4fc9-a6c0-451400df0714">Under $100</h3><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_053117_best-bed-pillows-20&amp;h=c9035d9e11791491d479dd400193d28e057bb4c817afe5acc6be9e42f9a357f7&amp;postID=61b8efc6f2a36b1ac9f4194f&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-pillow&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fsijohome.com%2Fproducts%2Fflexcool-memory-foam-pillow" data-autoaffiliated="true"><strong>Sijo FlexCool Memory Foam Pillow</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Sijo launched this adjustable pillow in fall 2024, and our first impressions of it are very positive.

To learn more about what to look for in the best pillows, we spoke with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.rebecca-robbins.com/">Dr. Rebecca Robbins</a>, sleep researcher, author, and instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and associate scientist at the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital. Below, find our recommendations for each consideration.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="534b20bb-9cf5-4ae7-a7cb-b3955d66f810" data-toc-id="534b20bb-9cf5-4ae7-a7cb-b3955d66f810">Sleep position</h3><p>Robbins told us the most significant consideration when picking a pillow is your preferred sleep position: side, back, or stomach. The goal of your pillow is to support your neck in a neutral position aligned with the rest of your spine. That alignment shifts depending on the position you&#39;re sleeping in. While we all move around during sleep, most of us spend the majority of our sleeping time in one position.&nbsp;</p><p>Not sure what your sleep position is? Consider what position you typically fall asleep or wake up in. Robbins also has an exercise she performs with her clients: Imagine you&#39;ve been up for 24 hours and are presented with a big, luxurious hotel bed; how would you lie down on it to go to sleep? The position you envision is likely your preferred sleep position and plays a significant role in what type of pillow will work best for you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ideal pillow by sleep position</strong></p><table style="minWidth: 100px"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sleep position</strong></td><td><strong>Softness</strong></td><td><strong>Loft</strong></td><td><strong>Material</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Side</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Supportive but not too firm</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">High (or with adjustable fill)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Down, down alternative, shredded memory foam, gel, buckwheat, microfiber</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Back</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium-firm</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Almost any</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Stomach</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Soft</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Low</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Down, down alternative, shredded memory foam, buckwheat, microfiber</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Side sleepers:</strong> Around 65% of the US population are side sleepers, according to Robbins, and this position requires the most loft and support to bridge the wide gap between the side of your head and where your shoulder rests on the mattress. If you&#39;re a side sleeper, choose a lofty pillow &mdash; ideally with an adjustable fill since there can be a lot of variability in the size of that shoulder gap from person to person. Robbins said hotels and sleep clinics outfit rooms with side sleepers in mind, so if you&#39;re buying pillows for a guest bedroom, a side-sleeper-friendly pillow is usually a good bet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Back sleepers:</strong> Back sleepers are the Goldilocks of pillow hunters &mdash; they need a pillow with just enough support to lift the back of the head to align with their shoulders. Back sleepers tend to benefit from a medium pillow made from a down or down alternative, though an adjustable pillow with at least one-third of the fill removed may work as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stomach sleepers:</strong> In the minority are stomach sleepers, who need the least support from their pillow. Typically, a thin, very soft pillow works best for stomach sleepers &mdash; just enough fill to cushion their face from the flat surface of the mattress.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="66922e11-090b-4da4-a04a-2dc21765096c" data-toc-id="66922e11-090b-4da4-a04a-2dc21765096c">Fill</h3><p>The material a pillow is filled with has a big impact on the feel of your pillow. Here&#39;s an overview of the major fill types:</p><p><strong>Down:&nbsp;</strong>Down consists of feathers taken from the underbelly of a goose or duck. It&#39;s an incredibly soft and comfortable material for pillows. While most modern down is triple-washed to remove dander, some allergy sufferers may want to avoid this material, as animal fibers are more prone to dust mites (which can exacerbate allergies) than synthetic fibers. You can read about our favorite down options in our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/home/best-down-pillow">best down pillows</a> guide.</p><p><strong>Down Alternative: </strong>Down alternative is typically any fibrous material that mimics the feel of true down. Microfiber is a popular and common down alternative, but bamboo or viscose fibers would also fall into the category, as well as polyfiber. The majority of the pillows in this guide are made from microfiber, which is generally hypoallergenic and breathable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Memory foam:&nbsp;</strong>Another popular fill is memory foam. We prefer pillows with shredded memory foam, which offer a more traditional and malleable pillow feeling. A solid block of memory foam may be preferred if you suffer from back and neck pain and need to keep your head immobilized during sleep.

We recommend looking for pillows that offer at least a 30-day trial with a money-back guarantee. This will allow you several weeks to decide if the pillow is right for you.</p><hr/><h2 id="26954495-d07d-4903-94a2-dd641ad5f782" data-toc-id="26954495-d07d-4903-94a2-dd641ad5f782" data-toc-label="How we tested">How we tested the best pillows</h2><p>Individual anatomy, sleep habits, and preferences profoundly impact how comfortable a pillow will be from person to person. Note that there is no one-size-fits-all best pillow.For that reason, our rating criteria for this guide relied heavily on the following considerations:</p><p><strong>Return policy and trial period: </strong>It&#39;s impossible to know how comfortable a pillow is going to be for you until you sleep on it, despite how comprehensive our guide aims to be. &#34;The most important thing is trying the pillows out to see what works for you,&#34; said Robbins, which includes being able to touch, lay on, and sleep with a pillow before deciding if it&#39;s right for you. For this guide, we only considered pillows that accept returns of used merchandise for a full refund with at least a 30-day trial window, which gives you ample time to decide if a pillow is right for you.</p><p><strong>Adjustability:</strong> We prioritized adjustable pillows with removable inserts or shredded fill for dialing in your perfect loft. This creates a more custom pillow that would better suit your needs. We also favored pillows available in varying lofts and firmnesses if the removable fill was not an option.</p><p><strong>Ease of use:</strong> We looked at how well each pillow fit a standard pillowcase, whether the pillow came with a case or protector, and whether all or parts of the pillow were washable for better hygiene and pillow longevity.</p><p><strong>Comfort:</strong> I slept on all of the pillows for at least three (sometimes agonizing) nights. I also enlisted a side sleeper and a stomach sleeper to try the pillows for a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p><hr/><h2 id="2584664d-d3f7-4642-a177-cdbb14273ab6" data-toc-id="2584664d-d3f7-4642-a177-cdbb14273ab6" data-toc-label="FAQ">Pillow FAQ</h2><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/61114bc238aff700189085bf?format=jpeg" height="834" width="1668" charset="" alt="best pillows   slide image 8 4x3"/><figcaption>Casper&#39;s pillow in pillow design has a supportive core surrounded by a  soft shell that doesn&#39;t go flat.<p class="copyright">Lauren Savoie/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><h3 class="faq-question">How long do pillows last?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sleep.org/replace-pillow/">National Sleep Foundation</a> recommends replacing a well-used pillow every couple of years. If you fold your pillow in half and it stays put, it&#39;s probably time for a new pillow. (This may not work with thin pillows.)</p><h3 class="faq-question">What are the best pillows for people with allergies?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Robbins recommends looking for a hypoallergenic pillow with a synthetic filling if you&#39;re prone to allergies. Pillows with animal fillings (such as down) may trigger allergies since dust mites like fillings made from animal material.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are pillows adjustable?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Not typically. Brands may offer their pillows in various lofts and firmness options. However, our top pick, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://coophomegoods.com/collections/pillows/products/the-original-pillow">Coop Home Goods Original Pillow</a>, is entirely adjustable, so you can find the loft that&#39;s right for you. Add or remove filling to reach your ideal comfort level.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What are the best pillows for hot sleepers?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Hot sleepers may find pillows with down alternative filling or shredded memory have have better airflow than down. Our guide to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/home/best-cooling-pillow">best cooling pillows</a> has several recommendations featuring options for sleepers who worry about overheating at night.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">How much do pillows cost?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Pillows cost anywhere from $10 to several hundred dollars. Because of how much time we spend sleeping, Robbins recommends considering a pillow as an investment that will pay you back in better sleep. &#34;No matter your budget, I really encourage people to splurge and invest in these products because they will help,&#34; she said.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Why do pillows turn yellow?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Sweat, oil, and skincare products can all turn your pillow yellow.

Follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions to best care for and clean your pillow. You may also want to fluff your pillows daily to extend their life.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What is pillow loft?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Loft refers to the height of your pillow, which determines how far off the mattress it lifts your head. experts recommend a pillow that keeps your head and neck aligned with the rest of your spine. side sleepers need more loft, while stomach sleepers need minimal loft.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What are the different types of pillow sizes?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Most pillows for sleeping come in two sizes: standard and king, while queen is another size option that you may see.&nbsp; Standard pillow sizes measure 20&#34; x 26&#34; inches, a queen measures 20&#34; x 30&#34; inches, and a king measures 20&#34; x 36&#34; inches. We recommend a standard or queen size for twin, full, and queen mattresses and king pillows for king or California king mattresses.</p><div id="slideshow"><div class="slide">Best overall<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/64b7f84676558a00189da0b4?format=jpeg" height="1249" width="1666" charset="" alt="The white Coop pillow sits on a bed with the logo text &#34;COOP&#34; and quilted design sewn on it."/><figcaption>The adjustable loft of the Coop Sleep Goods Original Pillow makes it the best option for most people.<p class="copyright">Lauren Savoie/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>It&#39;s rare to come across a product as thoughtfully designed as the Coop Sleep Goods Original Pillow.

Other thoughtful features like a washable cover, 5-year warranty, and 100-night trial make it our top recommendation.&nbsp;</p><p>When you open the box, a bright yellow insert walks you through how to customize the pillow and suggests how much fill to add or remove (it&#39;s more than you think) based on your preferred sleeping position. While the pillow arrives almost overfilled, it also comes with a half-pound bag of additional stuffing in case you need even more support.&nbsp;</p><p>I followed the package recommendations to remove about a third of the fill for back sleepers. The result felt deeply personalized, and it was very comfortable to sleep on with an outstanding balance of support and fluff.&nbsp;</p><p>We think most people will love the customization, especially if you prefer the springy feel of memory foam.</p><p>The brand has also released more shapes targeted for side and back sleepers, specifically with the customizable fill.&nbsp;</p><p>One drawback?

For side sleepers, this means bridging the gap between your ear and where your shoulder meets the mattress. But shoulder size and height can vary a lot from person to person, meaning one side sleeper might need a lofty pillow while another needs just a little lift.</p><p>The Coop pillow (our pick for best pillow overall) is ideal for side sleepers because it offers a lot of customization to help fill that gap, which is why we also named it top overall pick in our guide to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/home/best-pillow-for-side-sleepers">best pillow for side sleepers</a>. But if you&#39;re not a memory foam fan, your next best bet is the Casper Original Pillow.&nbsp;</p><p>Made from down-alternative hypoallergenic fill with a percale cotton shell, the Casper pillow feels a lot like the soft, plush pillows you&#39;d find in hotel rooms. A 2-inch gusset (the strip of fabric between seams that gives the pillow a more boxy shape) keeps the pillow lofted for the supportive lift that side sleepers require, but the plush fill still provides the &#34;sinking in&#34; sensation when you lay your head down.</p><p>Senior home editor Jaclyn Turner has slept on the Casper Original Pillow for over a year. She is a combo sleeper between back and side sleeping and most appreciates how it has never lost its loft and provides the plush support she craves.&nbsp;</p><p>Another one of the side sleepers who tried the pillow over several weeks also loved that it stayed cool throughout the night and kept its shape despite its softer fill. If you want a balance of support and softness, we recommend giving the Casper Original Pillow a try; just keep in mind that it&#39;s not as customizable or adjustable as other pillows.</p><p>Read our full review of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/home/casper-pillow-review">Casper Original Pillow</a>.</p></div><div class="slide">Best budget<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fdcc81bc910a400192e8498?format=jpeg" height="1250" width="1668" charset="" alt="Two white Beckham Hotel pillows sit flat on top of each other on a bed."/><figcaption>The Beckham Hotel Collection Gel Pillows are inexpensive and have a plush, premium feel.<p class="copyright">Lauren Savoie/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>If you&#39;re the type of person who can fall asleep just about anywhere or you&#39;re primarily concerned about price, the Beckham Hotel Collection Gel Pillow is the best bang for your buck.&nbsp;</p><p>These pillows are on the thinner side but have a gentle, down-like plushness that sets them apart from other inexpensive pillows I&#39;ve tried. While they&#39;re more squishy than supportive, they&#39;re a good choice for stomach sleepers, back sleepers, and anyone who likes to hug, fold, or stack their pillows at night.</p><p>I&#39;ve spent several months sleeping with these pillows on and off, and they haven&#39;t gone flat or gotten lumpy. They are a little less lofty and bouncy than when I first got them, but I like that they have a more lived-in feel.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;Gel pillow&#34; is a bit of a misnomer; there&#39;s no liquid or cooling gel in these pillows like there is in some other cooling pillows. Instead, these pillows are filled with hypoallergenic polyester gel fiber, similar to a down alternative in both feel and performance. Compared to denser materials like memory foam, the pillows stay relatively cool but stop short of actively cooling you.</p><p>While these pillows aren&#39;t adjustable, each pack comes with two pillows, so you can easily stack them to your desired comfort level.

I love how my head sinks into this soft pillow, but it&#39;s still supportive enough to keep its shape all night long. When I wake up, the pillow looks just as plush as when I fell asleep.</p><p>I&#39;m a very active sleeper who likes to move around a lot in bed and take my bedding with me, so I love that the pillow is equally plush and comfortable from all sides and angles. It&#39;s still soft and supportive when I inevitably fold it, scoop it, or hug it throughout the night. It&#39;s dense but quickly goes back to its original shape. Finally, it&#39;s hypoallergenic, which is a must for allergy sufferers like myself.&nbsp;</p><p>Multiple stomach sleepers who tried the pillow as part of our testing found it too lofty, even with the inner core removed.

Most stomach sleepers would benefit from a soft pillow with just a bit of loft, and for that, the Parachute Down-Alternative Pillow is our top choice.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the only pillow that received high marks for comfort from my husband, who is an avowed stomach sleeper and finds most pillows too lofty. The Parachute pillow elevates his head just enough to alleviate any neck strain, and the sateen cotton encasement keeps the pillow remarkably cool all night long, ideal for those, like him, who run hot.</p><p>We purchased four of these pillows a little over a year ago, and they were our mainstay before I started testing and evaluating pillows for this guide. In many ways, this pillow hits all the marks for me: it stays cool, is incredibly soft and comfortable, and is hypoallergenic. But while my husband happily drifts asleep with one of these pillows tucked under his head, I (a back sleeper) need to stack two or three to get the loft I need to fall asleep comfortably.&nbsp;</p><p>While the fill is thin enough that the pillow easily folds over for some support if you occasionally flip to your side or back during the night, it doesn&#39;t provide enough for those who spend most of the night in those positions. The pillow also won&#39;t offer much lift if you&#39;re looking to prop yourself up to read or watch TV while lounging in bed. Still, it&#39;s a great personal pillow for any stomach sleeper who has found other pillows too lofty.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">Best down<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/60aeb28fbee0fc0019d59ca5?format=jpeg" height="900" width="1200" charset="" alt="The Brooklinen down pillow on a bed."/><figcaption>While we think down-alternative is the best option for most people, true feather down like the fill found in the Brooklinen Down Pillow offers a luxurious feel.<p class="copyright">Connie Chen/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>Down makes for a very soft and comfortable pillow, but the material isn&#39;t for everyone.

Our top pick was Brooklinen&#39;s Down Pillow, which was plush and comfy for various sleeping styles.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s offered in three firmness options. We tried the mid-plush and think it&#39;s a great middle-of-the-road option to try out if you&#39;re not quite sure what kind of pillow you like best. The mid has a dual chamber design with a feather core for support and is surrounded by fluffy down clusters at a ratio of 30% down to 70% feathers. Meanwhile, the firm also has a dual design but a ratio of 14% clusters and 86% feathers, ideal for side sleepers while the plush option is filled with 100% down clusters for the soft comfort stomach sleepers craved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The down compressed easily but bounced back up quickly and was easy to fluff up.

As someone who spends more than 100 nights away from home in an average year, I know the pleasure of sinking into a plush, perfectly squishy hotel pillow. Since I&#39;m also a pillow reviewer, I make it a habit to investigate the tags on any hotel pillows I find particularly comfortable. More often than not, it turns out to be The Marriott Pillow.</p><p>Fortunately, Marriott allows you to buy the exact pillows it uses in its rooms for your home bedroom. To ensure the pillows live up to their hotel counterparts, I tested both a king-size and standard-size model at home. I&#39;m happy to report that they&#39;re identical in feel and comfort to the ones I&#39;ve experienced in Marriott&#39;s hotels.</p><p>These pillows are incredibly plush and fluffy. The combination down and lyocell fill results in a squishy feel that is soft without bottoming out. As a back and sometimes side sleeper, I found I have to double up on these pillows to get the right amount of support. However, my stomach-sleeping husband has completely commandeered these pillows, replacing our Parachute pillows as his personal pillow choice. Keep in mind that you&#39;ll need to fluff these pillows daily for best results; they do compact a bit during the night. Marriott also only offers a 30-day return policy, which is less than many of our other picks.</p></div><div class="slide">Best buckwheat<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/6108407a372268001a594260?format=jpeg" height="3024" width="4032" charset="" alt="A hand being placed on the Turmerry buckwheat pillow."/><figcaption>If you&#39;ve struggled to find a pillow that offers support, I highly recommend trying out a buckwheat pillow like this one from Turmerry.<p class="copyright">Lauren Savoie/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>Buckwheat hulls are a traditional pillow fill used in Japan and many other Asian countries.

They rustle a bit and add some texture to the pillow. But I just love how malleable and yet supportive the pillow is.</p><p>Most nights, I mold the pillow to the shape of my neck and feel totally supported the whole night. The hulls are heavier than a standard pillow fill, yet I can comfortably tuck my arm underneath it without creating too much pressure or overheating.</p><p>There&#39;s a reason why this type of pillow has been a popular choice for centuries worldwide. The pillow sleeps cool, is completely adjustable (just add or remove hulls to find your ideal loft), is sustainable and hypoallergenic, provides plenty of support, and works for all sleep styles.</p></div><div class="slide">What to look for when choosing pillows<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fdcc866c910a400192e849c?format=jpeg" height="1250" width="1668" charset="" alt="Several pillows that we tested for our guide to the best pillow lined up on a bed."/><figcaption>The best pillows for you will depend highly on whether you sleep on your back, stomach, or side.<p class="copyright">Lauren Savoie/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>The experts we spoke to recommend prioritizing three main criteria when shopping for a new pillow: sleep position, material, and trial period. Below, find our recommendations for each consideration.&nbsp;</p><h3>Sleep position</h3><p>Robbins told us the most significant consideration when picking a pillow is your preferred sleep position: side, back, or stomach. The goal of your pillow is to support your neck in a neutral position aligned with the rest of your spine. That alignment shifts depending on the position you&#39;re sleeping in. While we all move around during sleep, most of us spend the majority of our sleeping time in one position.&nbsp;</p><p>Not sure what your sleep position is? Consider what position you typically fall asleep or wake up in. Robbins also has an exercise she performs with her clients: Imagine you&#39;ve been up for 24 hours and are presented with a big, luxurious hotel bed; how would you lie down on it to go to sleep? The position you envision is likely your preferred sleep position and plays a significant role in what type of pillow will work best for you.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ideal pillow by sleep position</strong></p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 153.375px;"><strong>Sleep position</strong></td><td style="width: 153.375px;"><strong>Softness</strong></td><td style="width: 153.375px;"><strong>Loft</strong></td><td style="width: 153.375px;"><strong>Material</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 153.375px;">Side</td><td style="width: 153.375px;">Supportive but not too firm</td><td style="width: 153.375px;">High (or with adjustable fill)</td><td style="width: 153.375px;">Down, down alternative, shredded memory foam, gel, buckwheat, microfiber</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 153.375px;">Back</td><td style="width: 153.375px;">Medium-firm</td><td style="width: 153.375px;">Medium</td><td style="width: 153.375px;">Almost any</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 153.375px;">Stomach</td><td style="width: 153.375px;">Soft</td><td style="width: 153.375px;">Low</td><td style="width: 153.375px;">Down, down alternative, shredded memory foam, buckwheat, microfiber</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Side sleepers:</strong> Around 65% of the US population are side sleepers, according to Robbins, and this position requires the most loft and support to bridge the wide gap between the side of your head and where your shoulder rests on the mattress. If you&#39;re a side sleeper, choose a lofty pillow &mdash; ideally with an adjustable fill since there can be a lot of variability in the size of that shoulder gap from person to person. Robbins said hotels and sleep clinics outfit rooms with side sleepers in mind, so if you&#39;re buying pillows for a guest bedroom, a side-sleeper-friendly pillow is usually a good bet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Back sleepers:</strong> Back sleepers are the Goldilocks of pillow hunters &mdash; they need a pillow with just enough support to lift the back of the head to be in line with their shoulders. Back sleepers tend to benefit from a medium pillow made from down or down alternative, though an adjustable pillow with at least one-third of the fill removed may work as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stomach sleepers:</strong> In the minority are stomach sleepers, who need the least amount of support from their pillow. Typically, a thin, very soft pillow works best for stomach sleepers &mdash; just enough fill to cushion their face from the flat surface of the mattress.&nbsp;</p><h3>Fill</h3><p>The material a pillow is filled with has a big impact on the feel of your pillow. Here&#39;s an overview of the major fill types:</p><p><strong>Down:&nbsp;</strong>Down consists of feathers taken from the underbelly of a goose or duck. It&#39;s an incredibly soft and comfortable material for pillows. While most modern down is triple washed to remove dander, some allergy sufferers may want to avoid this material, as animal fibers are more prone to dust mites (which can exacerbate allergies) than synthetic fibers. You can read about our favorite down options in our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/home/best-down-pillow">best down pillows</a> guide.</p><p><strong>Microfiber/ Down Alternative: </strong>Microfiber is an incredibly popular down alternative. The majority of the pillows in this guide are made from microfiber. It&#39;s generally hypoallergenic and, when shredded finely, has a feel to mimic down.</p><p><strong>Memory foam:&nbsp;</strong>Another popular fill is memory foam. We prefer pillows with shredded memory foam, which offer a more traditional and malleable pillow feeling. A solid block of memory foam may be preferred if you suffer from back and neck pain and need to keep your head immobilized during sleep. Read more about the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/home/best-pillow-for-neck-pain">best pillows for neck pain</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Trial period</h3><p>The only way to know if a pillow is right for you is to sleep on it. We recommend looking for pillows that offer at least a 30-day trial with a money-back guarantee. This will allow you several weeks to decide if the pillow is right for you.</p></div><div class="slide">How we tested the best pillows<p>To learn more about what to look for in the best pillows, we spoke with <a href="http://www.rebecca-robbins.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Rebecca Robbins</a>, sleep researcher, author, and instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and associate scientist at the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital. However, there is no one-size-fits-all, best pillow for everyone.</p><p>Individual anatomy, sleep habits, and preferences profoundly impact how comfortable a pillow will be from person to person. For that reason, our rating criteria for this guide relied heavily on the following considerations:</p><p><strong>Return policy and trial period: </strong>It&#39;s impossible to know how comfortable a pillow is going to be for you until you sleep on it, despite how comprehensive our guide aims to be. &#34;The most important thing is trying the pillows out to see what works for you,&#34; said Robbins, which includes being able to touch, lay on, and sleep with a pillow before deciding if it&#39;s right for you. For this guide, we only considered pillows that accept returns of used merchandise for a full refund with at least a 30-day trial window, which gives you ample time to decide if a pillow is right for you.</p><p><strong>Adjustability:</strong> We prioritized adjustable pillows with removable inserts or shredded fill for dialing in your perfect loft. This creates a more custom pillow that would better suit your needs.</p><p><strong>Ease of use:</strong> We looked at how well each pillow fit a standard pillowcase, whether the pillow came with a case or protector, and whether all or parts of the pillow were washable for better hygiene and pillow longevity.</p><p><strong>Comfort:</strong> I slept on all of the pillows for at least three (sometimes agonizing) nights. I also enlisted a side sleeper and a stomach sleeper to try the pillows for a couple of weeks. We will develop a diverse sleep panel and have them test our top picks for additional feedback for future updates.</p></div><div class="slide">Pillow FAQs<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fdcca42c910a400192e84a7?format=jpeg" height="1250" width="1668" charset="" alt="A hand displaying the Casper pillow with removable filler."/><figcaption>Below you&#39;ll find answers to common pillow questions based off our own testing and interviews with experts.<p class="copyright">Lauren Savoie/Business Insider</p></figcaption></figure><h3 class="faq-question">How long do the best pillows last?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The <a href="https://www.sleep.org/replace-pillow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Sleep Foundation</a> recommends replacing a well-used pillow every couple of years. If you fold your pillow in half and it stays put, it&#39;s probably time for a new pillow. (This may not work with thin pillows.)</p><h3 class="faq-question">What are the best pillows for people with allergies?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Robbins recommends looking for a pillow with a synthetic filling if you&#39;re prone to allergies. Pillows with animal fillings (such as down) may trigger allergies since dust mites like fillings made from animal material.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are pillows adjustable?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Many are not. However, our top pick, the <a href="https://coophomegoods.com/collections/pillows/products/the-original-pillow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coop Home Goods Original Pillow</a> is entirely adjustable, so you can find the loft that&#39;s right for you. add or remove filling to reach your ideal comfort level.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What are the best pillows for hot sleepers?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Hot sleepers may find pillows with down or down alternative filling have better airflow than memory foam.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">How much do pillows cost?</h3><p class="faq-answer">You can find pillows at a range of price points, anywhere from $10 to several hundred dollars. Because of how much time we spend sleeping, Robbins recommends thinking of a pillow as an investment that will pay you back in better sleep.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Why do pillows turn yellow?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Sweat, oil, and skincare products can all turn your pillow yellow. Adding a <a href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_053117_best-bed-pillows-20&amp;h=481aa43fee529c5664b1ef122e4ab28b207b3a6656160509f3cdf7833937f756&amp;postID=61b8efc6f2a36b1ac9f4194f&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-pillow&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00MW4ZP5C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pillow protector</a> may help prevent the stains.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How often should I wash my pillow?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Typical recommendations range from every three to six months. Robbins recommends adding a <a href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biipgf_053117_best-bed-pillows-20&amp;h=481aa43fee529c5664b1ef122e4ab28b207b3a6656160509f3cdf7833937f756&amp;postID=61b8efc6f2a36b1ac9f4194f&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fhome%2Fbest-pillow&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00MW4ZP5C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pillow protector</a> (an encasement that adds another level of protection from allergens, body oils, dust mites, and other pests), too.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How do you wash a pillow?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Not every pillow can be washed. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions for how to best care for and clean your pillow. You should also fluff your pillows daily to extend their life.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What is pillow loft?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Loft refers to the height of your pillow, which determines how far off the mattress it lifts your head. experts recommend a pillow that keeps your head and neck aligned with the rest of your spine. side sleepers need more loft, while stomach sleepers need minimal loft.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What pillow sizes are available?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Most pillows for sleeping come in two sizes: standard and king, while queen is another size option that you may see.&nbsp; Standard pillow sizes measure 20&#34; x 26&#34; inches, a queen measures 20&#34; x 30&#34; inches and a king measures 20&#34; x 36&#34; inches. We recommend a standard or queen size for twin, full, and queen mattresses and king pillows for king or California king mattresses.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/home/best-pillow">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can also select it as part of a BT broadband bundle.</p><p>If the idea of tracking another streaming service grinds your gears, you might prefer the simpler option of adding it to your Amazon Prime membership <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biauto-61765-20&amp;h=491fa342951ab308b8e751f854be1f6b44a99c7e52105366fd3a6ecb2dc5501c&amp;postID=65085f6874fcf693ad39e179&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fwhere-to-watch-champions-league-live-streams-free&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fgp%2Fvideo%2Foffers%2Fref%3Datv_dp_atf_live_signup_3p_bb_t1IAAAAAAA0wr0%3Fforce_return_url%3D1%26return_url%3D%252Fgp%252Fvideo%252Fdetail%252FB0BDPT11YR%252Fref%253Datv_dp_sign_suc_3P%26benefitId%3Ddiscoverytntuk%26skipMarketingPage%3D1" data-autoaffiliated="true">as an add-on</a>. It&#39;s the same £30.99 a month, and you can cancel anytime. You might find watching it through Amazon Prime Video means you can enjoy Champions League live streams across more devices, as app support across TVs, consoles, and streaming sticks is much better for Prime Video than Discovery.</p><p>The UK version of Prime Video is also the <em>exclusive</em> home of a game each Tuesday during Champions League match weeks for some big matches featuring UK clubs. Here&#39;s a list of games exclusive to Amazon Prime Video over the coming weeks.

You will need a VPN to access the site and Champions League live streams outside Australia. It still works out cheaper, though. More details below.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="f9b8d8ab-322c-42e8-8eba-c5a0ce9246f5" data-toc-id="f9b8d8ab-322c-42e8-8eba-c5a0ce9246f5" data-toc-label="How to watch in Australia"><strong>Where to watch Champions League in Australia</strong></h2><p>The Champions League is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.stan.com.au/">Stan Sport</a> exclusive in Australia. So you&#39;ll need to sign up for Stan and then add Stan Sport as an add-on. The cheapest setup is $27 a month (for Stan Basic at $12 and Sport at $15). Better yet, it comes with a 30-day free trial first for the baseline tier - you&#39;ll still pay $15 for the Sport add-on from the off, though.</p><p>Stan Basic only streams in standard definition, but Stan Sport&#39;s content will stream in up to 4K, even when paired with this cheapest tier, so you might as well go Basic if you&#39;re just getting it for sport. However, if you want to check out the TV shows and movies too, HD is $16 a month/$21 for 4K (then add $15 for Sport). All are on rolling one-month contracts, so there&#39;s no long-term commitment.</p><p>If you&#39;re eying up this option via a <a target="_blank" class="" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biauto-61765-20&amp;h=7e0ef3d482acb0967b938e4b0cf9ed11f3292de012ff47ab7bb5d6d5ad7c5171&amp;postID=65085f6874fcf693ad39e179&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fstreaming%2Fwhere-to-watch-champions-league-live-streams-free&amp;site=bi&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-6415797-13382109">VPN</a> as a cheaper alternative to your country&#39;s Champions League streaming service, <strong><em>we can confirm it will work</em></strong>. We were able to pay with a UK bank card and have full access to the streaming service. You could also use a travel card like Revolut to pay in local currency so you don&#39;t get a foreign transaction fee from your bank.</p><h2 id="9f80c7c0-66d1-441f-9be1-1c5663d189f4" data-toc-id="9f80c7c0-66d1-441f-9be1-1c5663d189f4" data-toc-label="How to watch in the US">Where to watch Champions League in the US</h2><p>This is where &#39;soccer&#39; being so far down the rankings of the most popular sports in the USA really pays off for viewers who want to enjoy the most prestigious competition in club football.</p><p>You&#39;ll find every last Champions League game live streaming on Paramount Plus from just $7.99 a month or $59.99 a year (you wouldn&#39;t get two months of action for that annual price in the UK!). So yes, you can opt for the cheapest Paramount Plus tier and still get the Champions League despite it not having CBS, as the games will run via separate feeds. If you have CBS already, you&#39;ll find it airs some games, but nowhere near as many as Paramount Plus.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="43e3d022-b72e-4c28-befa-3ae299af822e" data-toc-id="43e3d022-b72e-4c28-befa-3ae299af822e" data-toc-label="Can I access Paramount Plus with a VPN?">Can I access Champions League on Paramount Plus with a VPN?</h2><p>Yes and no. If you set up Paramount Plus while already living in the US and are traveling abroad, and want to keep watching, you&#39;re all set. A VPN will indeed let you tune in like you were still in the US.</p><p>If you have a non-US subscription, like in the UK, you won&#39;t be able to access the US version&#39;s content with those same login credentials via a VPN on the app or the US website, as they&#39;re essentially different apps and services in each country. Unlike Netflix, which will allow one login to work anywhere via a VPN.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;re outside the US and want a US account, Paramount Plus has made it difficult for outsiders to create one recently. That&#39;s because you&#39;ll need a US form of payment, and we&#39;ve found international currency cards, like Revolut, don&#39;t count.</p><p>What about PayPal? You&#39;ll need to create a US PayPal account, which must be verified by a US mobile phone number. So, <em>if</em> you can get around all this, you can enjoy the best value Champions League live streams in the world.</p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.</em></p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/streaming/where-to-watch-champions-league-live-streams-free">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

It comes with two 23- by 16.2-inch silicone liners that can easily be cut to fit just about any oven&#39;s bottom rack. Its Teflon coating helps it withstand up to 500 degrees. You can also use this multi-functional liner as a baking mat or grill mat. These oven liners are dishwasher safe.</p><p>Another great option are the slightly more expensive but PFOA-free <a target="_blank" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biipg_021121_best-oven-liners-20&amp;h=8ad81d64be23520afa3341f5b0105d737861f70e6c551d04f162854b63ee8fa6&amp;postID=61b8efc8f2a36b1ac9f431bf&amp;postSlug=guides%2Fkitchen%2Fbest-oven-liners&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOven-Liners-Bottom-Non-Stick-Accessory%2Fdp%2FB08Q3J3GB6%3Fth%3D1" data-autoaffiliated="true">Linda&#39;s Essentials Oven Liners</a>.</p></div><div class="slide">Best for electric ovens<p>This simple, but effective non-stick mat will save you time and money. It&#39;s easy to slide in and out of the oven while cooking. Electric ovens are the only oven type where you can place oven liners directly onto the oven floor. However, unless your electric oven has a visible coil heating element, you should still lay this liner on the bottom oven rack for safety; many modern ovens have hidden heating elements below the oven floor. Measuring 16.5 by 23 inches, this liner easily catches hot oven drips and spills. It&#39;s safe up to 500 degrees, but don&#39;t forget to remove it before using any self-cleaning settings.</p></div><div class="slide">Best for gas ovens<p>This three-piece set of thick oven liners is multi-functional but especially great for gas ovens. Measuring 23 by 16.25 inches, these are the best liners to easily trim and fit around vents so you can ensure airflow. Be sure to include a one-inch gap between the oven and any surrounding vents. These liners also work well on stovetop burners because they are made with a heat-resistant, extra-thick material that can withstand close fire, as well as up to 500 degrees in the oven. They are also dishwasher-safe for easy reuse.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">Best for fan ovens<p>Some thin mats flap around every time you open and close the oven door, but this heavy-duty, two-piece set combats that problem thanks to its thick Teflon construction. It&#39;s also tested to FDA standards, so you can cook food directly on the liner without having to worry about any added flavor or smells. At 17 by 25 inches, it should fit most standard ovens, but if not, you can also easily cut it to your preference. It&#39;s safe up to 500 degrees.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="slide">Best disposable<p>If you&#39;re making a big dinner and don&#39;t have time to clean between dishes, this 10-pack of disposable foil oven liners is a convenient way to keep the oven in tip-top shape. These liners are a durable and safer alternative to aluminum foil that you can use on the bottom oven rack. Measuring 18.5 by 15.5 inches, each sheet is big enough to catch falling food, but small enough to easily fit a variety of oven sizes. Although disposable, this pack should last you a few months. These are safe to use up to 450 degrees.</p></div><div class="slide">What to look for in an oven liner<p>Oven liners are straightforward kitchen products, but there are a few basic considerations that will help you get the most out of one.</p><p><strong>Ease of cleaning: </strong>If you&#39;re buying a reusable oven liner, you want one that keeps its shape and texture while undergoing regular cleaning. Thicker ones usually hold up better than thinner ones, but the tradeoff is more heat deflection.</p><p><strong>Dimensions: </strong>Most liners are somewhat customizable in that you can cut them to fit your oven. Just make sure it&#39;s not covering the edges where air exchange is necessary.</p><p><strong>Materials: </strong>There are always trade offs, but always check that the liner you choose is compatible with the oven in which you&#39;re placing it. Fiberglass and silicone are the most durable, but they may affect how long it takes for your oven to heat up. You&#39;ll get convenience and an unaffected oven temperature with thinner and disposable liners, though you can&#39;t use them at the higher heats.</p></div><div class="slide">Oven liner FAQs<figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/64135c710308e00018551824?format=jpeg" height="3730" width="4973" charset="" alt="A person wearing oven mitts taking a pie out of an oven oven."/><figcaption><p class="copyright">The Good Brigade/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Are oven liners safe for all ovens?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, but check that the liner is compatible with your type of oven. You also want to make sure that you stay below the maximum temperature rating for the oven liner you buy. While most oven liners are safe to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, broiling can be risky, and most manufacturers recommend removing your oven liner to do so.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Can you bake on an oven liner?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, some oven liners double as <span>baking or grill mats. Check the manufacturer guidelines for the top oven-safe temperature and any other safety warnings.

Confirm with the instruction manuals of both your oven and the liner.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Are oven liners the same as oven mats?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, oven liners and mats perform the same function, but it&#39;s more important to know whether or not they may also be used as baking or grilling mats.</p></div></div><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/kitchen/best-oven-liners">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fire TV products are some of our favorite streaming solutions thanks to their speedy performance and affordable prices. Right now, you can choose between stick, cube, and full-fledged smart TV models.&nbsp;</p><p>Entry-level Fire TV options, like the standard <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biauto-57767-20&amp;h=971a66bb61e5543f2021ea083143b31648e6bbf1d6228a636f490ae179b94e16&amp;postID=634083c138646775ad314117&amp;postSlug=guides%2Ftech%2Famazon-fire-tv-buying-guide&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08C1W5N87" data-autoaffiliated="true">Fire TV Stick</a>, offer HD playback, while the best Fire TV devices, like the second-gen <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biauto-57767-20&amp;h=568bfc28e92b59a0f63b032d2b79611b3bee75c03de7c6309e27ed6a658cd770&amp;postID=634083c138646775ad314117&amp;postSlug=guides%2Ftech%2Famazon-fire-tv-buying-guide&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BP9SNVH9" data-autoaffiliated="true">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>, support Ultra HD video and Dolby Vision for enhanced color and contrast. Amazon also sells its own smart TVs that have the Fire TV operating system (OS) built in. Though these sets don&#39;t rank among the top TVs you can buy, they&#39;re decent budget options for fans of Amazon&#39;s ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But with so many different Fire TV models to consider, it can be tricky to determine which is right for your needs. To help you pick the best Fire Stick or display for your setup, we&#39;ve detailed all the ins and outs of each model.</p><h2 id="c83c4fa4-dfcb-4589-89d4-121cf9ca2ad2" data-toc-id="c83c4fa4-dfcb-4589-89d4-121cf9ca2ad2" data-toc-label="Fire TV deals">How to get a great deal on the best Fire TV devices</h2><p>The best Fire Sticks and smart TVs get big deals during major sales events like Amazon Prime Day, though smaller deals pop up throughout the year. The next opportunity to get a great discount on a Fire TV device will be during Black Friday on November 29 and Cyber Monday on December 2. </p><h2 id="531c75b7-d971-4480-b632-c4799f4e7c3a" data-toc-id="531c75b7-d971-4480-b632-c4799f4e7c3a" data-toc-label="Fire TV Stick Lite">Fire TV Stick Lite</h2><p>The Fire TV Stick Lite is the most affordable of the lineup, making it the best Fire Stick on a budget. Like the company&#39;s other stick models, this compact dongle plugs into your TV&#39;s HDMI port. Once powered on, you can navigate through the stick&#39;s interface to access all of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-streaming-service">best streaming services</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fire TV Stick Lite matches the video quality of the more expensive standard Fire TV Stick. The only notable difference between this model and the regular Stick is its remote. The Lite includes an Alexa Voice Remote Lite, which lacks TV controls, like power and volume buttons. Other than that, both models are essentially the same.</p><p>The Fire TV Stick Lite can stream videos at up to 1080p resolution, which makes it ideal for an HDTV. The device also supports high dynamic range (HDR) using the HDR10 and HDR10+ formats. This feature delivers enhanced colors and contrast when streaming HDR videos through apps like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a>. That said, most TVs that support HDR are 4K models, and if you have a 4K TV, we highly recommend you pay a bit more for one of Amazon&#39;s 4K sticks.</p><p>If your TV doesn&#39;t support 4K, the Fire TV Stick Lite will suit your streaming needs just fine. However, keep in mind that the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biauto-57767-20&amp;h=971a66bb61e5543f2021ea083143b31648e6bbf1d6228a636f490ae179b94e16&amp;postID=634083c138646775ad314117&amp;postSlug=guides%2Ftech%2Famazon-fire-tv-buying-guide&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08C1W5N87" data-autoaffiliated="true">standard Fire TV Stick</a> occasionally goes on sale for even less than the Lite. When that happens, there&#39;s no reason to consider this model.</p><h2 id="43a01f89-924d-4fa1-a0bd-a0fc0ba7f424" data-toc-id="43a01f89-924d-4fa1-a0bd-a0fc0ba7f424" data-toc-label="Fire TV Stick">Fire TV Stick</h2><p>The standard Fire TV Stick matches the 1080p and HDR streaming quality of the Lite model but has an improved remote with TV controls like power and volume. Though it usually costs $10 more than the Lite model, it&#39;s sometimes on sale for less than that entry-level option.&nbsp;</p><p>The base Fire TV Stick will meet most people&#39;s HD streaming needs, but if you own a 4K TV, we recommend spending the extra money on one of Amazon&#39;s more advanced 4K streaming devices.</p><h2 id="1c2a37b6-7bfe-4e08-abd3-53573611dd01" data-toc-id="1c2a37b6-7bfe-4e08-abd3-53573611dd01" data-toc-label="Fire TV Stick 4K">Fire TV Stick 4K</h2><p>As the name suggests, the Fire TV Stick 4K streams at a higher resolution than the Fire TV Stick or Stick Lite. With <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/what-is-4k">4K support</a>, you&#39;ll get a sharper, more detailed image when watching 4K videos on a 4K TV. </p><p>This model also carries over HDR playback but adds support for the more advanced Dolby Vision format, which is missing on the Lite and standard Fire TV Stick. Dolby Vision can give your TV more detailed guidance for displaying HDR images, but only when watching Dolby Vision content on a compatible display. Check out our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/what-is-hdr-tv">HDR TV guide</a> for more details about different HDR formats.</p><p>The latest version of the Fire TV Stick 4K was released in September 2023. It has a slightly tweaked design with rounded edges, more memory, and an improved processor. Amazon says it&#39;s around 25% faster than the first-gen model. It also now supports WiFi 6 when used with a compatible router.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fire TV Stick 4K is also one of the few Fire TV models with access to the Xbox app. With the Xbox app, a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> Ultimate membership, and a Bluetooth controller, you can stream Xbox games to your Fire TV Stick 4K. This means you can play high-end games without a console.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All things considered, this model is a good fit for those with a 4K TV. However, if you&#39;re willing to spend a bit more, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max offers slightly better performance.</p><h2 id="06c59410-d2f7-4357-846e-5ccc54e22230" data-toc-id="06c59410-d2f7-4357-846e-5ccc54e22230" data-toc-label="Fire TV Stick 4K Max">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</h2><p>The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is one of our picks for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-streaming-devices">best streaming devices</a> you can buy. It carries over everything you get with the regular Fire TV Stick 4K while offering a faster processor and GPU, as well as more storage. This makes navigation a little snappier and lets you save more apps and games.</p><p>Amazon released the latest version of its Fire TV Stick 4K Max in September 2023. Compared to the previous-generation edition, this new model has an upgraded processor, double the amount of storage, and support for WiFi 6E routers. It also has a revised design with rounded edges.</p><p>Unlike other Fire TV Sticks, the 4K Max supports Amazon&#39;s Fire TV Ambient Experience, which lets you display art, photos, and widgets for things like the weather and your calendar. And like the standard Fire TV Stick 4K, it also supports the Xbox app for Game Pass streaming.</p><p>The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is typically just $10 more than the standard Fire TV Stick 4K, so we think it&#39;s the best Fire TV option for people with 4K TVs.</p><h2 id="deb87573-2b8f-4920-a7d3-f4a606e2e0c2" data-toc-id="deb87573-2b8f-4920-a7d3-f4a606e2e0c2" data-toc-label="Fire TV Cube">Fire TV Cube</h2><p>The Fire TV Cube is the best Fire TV for pure processing power. It incorporates all of the key features of the Fire TV Stick 4K Max but has a beefier CPU and is meant to be a more traditional home theater device. Instead of a dongle that hangs out of your TV&#39;s HDMI port, the Cube is a compact box that sits on your TV stand and plugs into your display with an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-hdmi-cable">HDMI cable</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the Fire TV Cube&#39;s biggest benefits is its support for hands-free Alexa voice control without a remote. In other words, the Cube can act like an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-amazon-echo">Echo device</a>. The newest model also has an HDMI passthrough port to control cable boxes, twice as much storage space as the stick models, 4K upscaling to make HD videos look better, and overall faster performance.</p><p>The Fire TV Cube is a premium streaming box designed to compete with devices like the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biauto-57767-20&amp;h=939620bf3f3efa19868c784dd6a9fc0721f7f561a767516fb651b74da2beddd4&amp;postID=634083c138646775ad314117&amp;postSlug=guides%2Ftech%2Famazon-fire-tv-buying-guide&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-tv%2Fapple-tv-4k" data-autoaffiliated="true">Apple TV 4K</a>, <a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/roku-ultra-2024-price-release-date-specs">Roku Ultra</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/google-tv-streamer-4k-price-release-date-specs">Google TV Streamer</a>. It&#39;s best suited for home theater enthusiasts who want the brand&#39;s absolute best quality and fastest technology.</p><h2 id="4e40a4eb-9868-47e5-9760-a8de47ccb842" data-toc-id="4e40a4eb-9868-47e5-9760-a8de47ccb842" data-toc-label="Fire TV 2-Series">Fire TV 2-Series</h2><p>Amazon also sells its own lineup of full-fledged smart TVs, which all use a built-in version of the Fire TV OS. This means you can stream your favorite apps without an extra device. Though Amazon&#39;s displays don&#39;t make our guide to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-tv">best TVs</a>, they&#39;re still worthwhile budget options if you&#39;re a fan of the Fire TV ecosystem. The 2-Series is Amazon&#39;s entry-level HDTV model designed for people who just want a basic smart TV for casual viewing.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2-Series is available in a 32-inch 720p screen or 40-inch 1080p screen. Both models support HDR processing using the standard HDR10 format, but the 2-Series can&#39;t deliver the brightness or color needed to really take advantage of high-dynamic-range playback. For this reason, we only recommend this model for people who want a cheap TV that doesn&#39;t take up too much space.</p><h2 id="76e15107-18dc-409d-b8bf-355427d2da9d" data-toc-id="76e15107-18dc-409d-b8bf-355427d2da9d" data-toc-label="Fire TV 4-Series">Fire TV 4-Series</h2><p>The 4-Series steps things up from HD to Ultra HD with a 4K resolution screen. Models are available in 43-, 50-, and 55-inch sizes.&nbsp;</p><p>Though it supports 4K playback, the 4-Series has subpar HDR performance and lacks advanced features like wide color support and Dolby Vision. It&#39;s a decent TV for buyers who want a smaller, affordable 4K display for a bedroom, but it&#39;s not suited for home theater use.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="4cdda2f4-6cdb-4b92-b82a-ed1dba0a46eb" data-toc-id="4cdda2f4-6cdb-4b92-b82a-ed1dba0a46eb" data-toc-label="Fire TV Omni Series">Fire TV Omni Series</h2><p>The Omni Series Fire TV adds support for hands-free Alexa voice control without using the remote. You can control power, volume, navigation, and search with spoken commands through the TV&#39;s built-in microphones. And the TV can also serve as an Alexa smart home hub even when the display is off.&nbsp;</p><p>Models range in size from 43 to 75 inches. Every model supports 4K resolution and HDR10, and the 65- and 75-inch models add support for Dolby Vision.</p><p>Unfortunately, the TV&#39;s picture quality and navigation speed are underwhelming for its price. There are simply better-looking displays from brands like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/tcl-q7-qled-4k-tv-review">TCL</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/hisense-u7k-4k-tv-review">Hisense</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/roku-plus-series-qled-4k-tv-review">Roku</a> that cost around the same. That said, the Omni is a decent buy when it&#39;s on sale during deal events like Black Friday and Prime Day. We only recommend picking up the 65-inch model when you can snag it for under $500.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/amazon-omni-fire-tv-review">Amazon Fire TV Omni review</a>.</p><h2 id="3010240b-769a-475b-a6aa-9d469ebaff97" data-toc-id="3010240b-769a-475b-a6aa-9d469ebaff97" data-toc-label="Fire TV Omni QLED Series">Fire TV Omni QLED Series</h2><p>Amazon&#39;s Omni QLED is the best Fire TV display you can buy, and it offers a big step up from the regular Omni Series. It carries over hands-free Alexa support while adding advanced picture features like quantum dots and local dimming. These features enable it to deliver much better color and contrast performance.&nbsp;</p><p>The TV also has an ambient mode that can display art and widgets when it senses someone has walked into the room. Sizes range from 43 to 75 inches, but the 43-inch model does not include local dimming.</p><p>The 65-inch model&#39;s list price of $800 is high for what you get, and the set doesn&#39;t match the overall performance of the very <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-4k-tv">best 4K TVs</a> in this class. However, we&#39;ve seen it drop to $600 during big sales events, offering much better value at that price.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out our full <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/amazon-fire-tv-omni-qled-4k-tv-review">Amazon Fire TV Omni QLED review</a> and our guide to all of the <a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-smart-tvs">best smart TVs</a>.</p><h2 id="a98e0b22-66c9-405f-8cfb-adabd5e0a81d" data-toc-id="a98e0b22-66c9-405f-8cfb-adabd5e0a81d" data-toc-label="Fire TV Soundbar">Fire TV Soundbar</h2><p>Amazon&#39;s latest Fire TV-branded product isn&#39;t actually a streaming device at all. Instead, it&#39;s a soundbar.</p><p>The Fire TV soundbar is a compact 2.0-channel speaker designed to rest in front of your TV. It features an HDMI eARC and optical port for easy connection to most modern displays, and it also supports Bluetooth for wireless music playback from a mobile device.</p><p>At 24 inches wide, the soundbar is relatively small, which should make it easy to set up on most TV stands. Though it doesn&#39;t include a subwoofer or offer advanced features like up-firing audio drivers with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/what-is-dolby-atmos">Dolby Atmos</a> support, the Fire TV Soundbar does support DTS Virtual:X to simulate surround sound. That said, at this price range and performance class, buyers shouldn&#39;t expect too much from this feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And despite the Fire TV branding, this is a soundbar only. It does not feature built-in support for streaming video apps. The base model only includes a standard remote, but you can pay more for a package with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=biauto-57767-20&amp;h=620249b2b00aa16bc21f22a37d0e60f3b976be71dffd112e8614f22ce166e4f5&amp;postID=634083c138646775ad314117&amp;postSlug=guides%2Ftech%2Famazon-fire-tv-buying-guide&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmazon-Soundbar-Alexa-Voice-Remote%2Fdp%2FB0CDYPZ1PY" data-autoaffiliated="true">an Alexa Voice Remote Pro</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the specs and affordable $120 price tag, Amazon is positioning this as an entry-level soundbar for people who just want a simple, compact, and inexpensive upgrade for their TV&#39;s speakers.</p><p>But if you&#39;re looking for something with more oomph, check out our soundbar buying guides to see our top recommendations:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-soundbar">Best soundbars</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-dolby-atmos-soundbars">Best Dolby Atmos soundbars</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-budget-soundbars">Best budget soundbars</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-soundbars-with-subwoofers">Best soundbars with subwoofers</a></li></ul><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/amazon-fire-tv-buying-guide">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>
