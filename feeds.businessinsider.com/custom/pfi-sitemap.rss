Any student loan that isn&#39;t offered through the federal government is considered a private student loan.</p><h3>How do private student loans different from federal loans?</h3><p>Unlike federal student loans, which are issued by the government, private student loans are issued by private lending companies and don&#39;t offer as many opportunities for loan forgiveness.</p><p>Take the federal student loan forbearance offered by the government during the coronavirus pandemic. While private lenders may have offered their own help for people experiencing hardships, private student loan borrowers didn&#39;t get that widespread benefit or keep interest rates at 0%.</p><p>While federal student loans have fixed interest rates, private loans can have fixed or variable rates, and they&#39;re typically higher than federal rates. Private student loans generally offer fewer options for repayment.</p><p>If you&#39;ll need student loans to afford college, you should start by exploring your federal loan options by completing the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/how-to-fill-out-the-fafsa-financial-aid">FAFSA</a> (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Since federal loans usually have more favorable terms, prioritize these before private student loans.</p><h2>Top Private Student Loan Lenders</h2><p>The best lenders have competitive <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/current-student-loan-interest-rates">student loan interest rates</a>, a variety of repayment terms, and no origination fees. Our list of the best options includes picks for both undergraduate and graduate students.</p><h3 data-toc-label="SoFi"><strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/sofi-student-loans-review">SoFi Undergraduate Student Loans</a></strong></h3><p>SoFiÂ® private student loans are best for graduate students. SoFi is one of the few lenders offering lower interest rates for graduate school loans than undergraduate loans.&nbsp;</p><p>While SoFi&#39;s interest rates are competitive with others on the list, what makes SoFi unique are its other features. This lender offers some good protections for student loan borrowers, like career services. Additionally, SoFi&#39;s student loans have no late fees (though it&#39;s worth noting that interest will still accrue).</p><p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> High maximum loan amount. SoFi&#39;s minimum loan amount is $1,000 &mdash; if you need a small student loan, it might be worth turning to a lender that makes smaller loans.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><strong class="headline-bold">Regular Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong>:&nbsp;</strong>5.79% - 15.86% variable and 3.99% - 14.83% fixed (with AutoPay discount)</p><p><strong>Fees:</strong> N/A</p><p><strong>Loan Amount Range:</strong> Minimum of $1,000</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/sofi-student-loans-review">SoFi Student Loans Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="Ascent"><strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/ascent-student-loans-review">Ascent Undergraduate Student Loans</a></strong></h3><p>Ascent private student loans are a flexible option for almost any student loan borrowers. Interest rates are competitive, and terms range from five to 15 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Cosigners are allowed and encouraged. A relatively unique feature is Ascent&#39;s cosigner release. Make 12 consecutive on-time payments, and Ascent can release a cosigner from your student loan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What to watch out for: </strong>Ascent limits borrowers&#39; total loans to $400,000, including any other federal or private student loans outside of Ascent.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><strong class="headline-bold">Regular Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong>:&nbsp;</strong>6.00% - 15.41% variable and 3.59% - 14.59% fixed (with AutoPay discount, varies by plan)</p><p><strong>Fees:&nbsp;</strong>None</p><p><strong>Loan Amount Range:&nbsp;</strong>$2,001 - $200,000 ($200,000 aggregate total)</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/ascent-student-loans-review">Ascent Student Loans Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="Earnest"><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/earnest-student-loans-review">Earnest Undergraduate Student Loans</a></h3><p>Earnest&#39;s private student loans offer low starting interest rates and very flexible repayment terms. Earnest has four options for repayment, including a nine-month deferral after school. Earnest doesn&#39;t charge any fees, including prepayment or origination fees on private student loans, which makes it a strong option.&nbsp;</p><p>Earnest also advertises the ability to skip a payment once per year. But that doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re off the hook for that payment, since interest will still add up and your payoff will be delayed. Your payments could be higher if you take full advantage of these features, and they could increase your total payoff time and loan amount.&nbsp;</p><p>But if used the right way, Earnest&#39;s private student loans could still beat the competition with such low starting interest rates.</p><p><strong>What to watch out for: </strong>Some of Earnest&#39;s flexible features aren&#39;t the right fit for everyone. The ability to delay loans for nine months may not be as great as it sounds, since interest still accrues during this period, growing your loan&#39;s balance.</p><p><strong><strong class="headline-bold">Regular Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong>:&nbsp;</strong>5.62% - 16.85% variable and 3.74% - 16.49% fixed (with AutoPay discount)</p><p><strong>Fees:&nbsp;</strong>$0</p><p><strong>Loan Amount Range:&nbsp;</strong>$1,000 - 100% of education cost</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/earnest-student-loans-review">Earnest Student Loans Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="College Ave"><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/college-ave-student-loans-review">College Ave Undergraduate Student Loans</a></h3><p>College Ave ties has one of the lowest starting interest rates on private student loans, since undergraduate fixed-rate loans start with an interest rate of 3.69%. Interest rates for grad school students are also competitive with SoFi&#39;s lower interest rates for this group.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s a good choice for both graduate and undergraduate students, and it offers four options for repayment. College Ave allows cosigners for loans and offers parent loans in addition to undergraduate and graduate loans, starting at the same interest rate as the undergraduate interest rate.</p><p><strong>What to watch out for:&nbsp;</strong>Late payment penalty. You&#39;ll fork over a late payment of 5% of the amount due, capped at $25 if you fall behind on your payments.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><strong class="headline-bold">Regular Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong>: </strong>5.59% - 14.49% variable and 3.59% - 17.99% fixed (with AutoPay discount)</p><p><strong>Fees:&nbsp;</strong>late payment of 5% of the amount due, capped at $25</p><p><strong>Loan Amount Range: </strong>Minimum of $1,000</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/college-ave-student-loans-review">College Ave Student Loans Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="Sallie Mae"><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/sallie-mae-student-loans-review">Sallie Mae Undergraduate Student Loans</a></h3><p>Sallie Mae doesn&#39;t charge any origination and prepayment fees, and you also get four months of the study service Chegg for free. Chegg offers expert Q&amp;A, and students can submit up to 20 questions per month.</p><p><strong>What to watch out for: </strong>Sallie Mae sets your repayment term length, so if you want to choose your term length another lender is a better option.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><strong class="headline-bold">Regular Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong>:&nbsp;</strong>5.54% - 15.70% variable and 3.49% - 15.49% fixed</p><p><strong>Fees:&nbsp;</strong>late payment of 5% of the amount due, capped at $25</p><p><strong>Loan Amount Range:&nbsp;</strong>Starts at $1,000</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/sallie-mae-student-loans-review">Sallie Mae Student Loans Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="Custom Choice"><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/custom-choice-student-loans-review">Custom Choice Undergraduate Student Loans</a></h3><p>Custom Choice offers loans of up to $99,999 annually that come without fees, and you can check your rates within a few minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>Custom Choice also offers a 2% reduction on your loan principal after you provide the lender with proof of graduation, as well as a .25% interest rate reduction when you sign up for AutoPay.</p><p><strong>What to watch out for:</strong> No mobile app. If you want to manage your loans on the go, you won&#39;t be able to with Custom Choice.</p><p><strong><strong class="headline-bold">Regular Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong>: </strong> 5.39% - 15.57% variable and 4.43% - 14.04% fixed</p><p><strong>Fees:&nbsp;</strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Loan Amount Range:&nbsp;</strong>$1,000 - $99,999</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/custom-choice-student-loans-review">Custom Choice Student Loans Review</a></em></p><h3 data-toc-label="MPower"><strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/mpower-financing-student-loans-review">MPower Financing Undergraduate Student Loan</a></strong></h3><p>MPower Financing offers fixed loans designed for international students. You can get a loan without a cosigner, collateral, or US credit history. Most other lenders that offer loans to international students require a US citizen or permanent resident to cosign on the loan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What to watch out for: </strong>High interest rates. While the lender&#39;s starting interest rates are higher than many of the other lenders on this list, we included it because of its accessibility for international students.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><strong class="headline-bold">Regular Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong>:&nbsp;</strong>13.74% to 14.75% fixed (with AutoPay discount)</p><p><strong>Fees:&nbsp;</strong>5% origination fee and undisclosed late fee</p><p><strong>Loan Amount Range:&nbsp;</strong>$2,001 &mdash; $100,000 lifetime</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/mpower-financing-student-loans-review">MPower Financing Student Loans Review</a></em></p><h2 id="which-bank-is-the-most-trustworthy?"><strong>Which Private Student Loan Lender Is the Most Trustworthy?</strong></h2><p>We&#39;ve only selected private student loan lenders with no public controversies in the last three years. We&#39;ve also compared each institution&#39;s Better Business Bureau&nbsp;score.</p><p>The BBB, a non-profit organization focused on consumer protection and trust, evaluates companies by judging a business&#39;s responses to consumer complaints, honesty in advertising, and clarity about business practices. Here is each company&#39;s score:</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.2357%;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50.8937%; text-align: center;"><strong>Lender</strong></td><td style="width: 75.6897%; text-align: center;"><strong>BBB grade</strong></td></tr><tr style="height: 43px;"><td style="width: 50.8937%; height: 162px; text-align: center;"><p>SoFi Student Loans</p></td><td style="width: 75.6897%; text-align: center;">A+</td></tr><tr style="height: 88px;"><td style="width: 50.8937%; height: 159px; text-align: center;"><p>Ascent Student Loans</p></td><td style="width: 75.6897%; text-align: center;">B</td></tr><tr style="height: 21px;"><td style="width: 50.8937%; height: 96px; text-align: center;"><p>Earnest Student Loans</p></td><td style="width: 75.6897%; text-align: center;">A+</td></tr><tr style="height: 21px;"><td style="width: 50.8937%; height: 161px; text-align: center;"><p>College Ave Student Loans</p></td><td style="width: 75.6897%; text-align: center;">A+</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 50.8937%; text-align: center;"><p>Sallie Mae Student Loans</p></td><td style="width: 75.6897%; text-align: center;">A+</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 50.8937%; text-align: center;"><p>Custom Choice Student Loans</p></td><td style="width: 75.6897%; text-align: center;">N/A</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 50.8937%; text-align: center;"><p>MPower Financing Student Loans</p></td><td style="width: 75.6897%; text-align: center;">A+</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Of our top picks, only Ascent and Custom Choice are not currently A or higher by the BBB.

You should ask others about their experiences with the businesses before deciding against borrowing from the companies.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">How to Choose the Best Private Student Loan</h2><h3>Key Factors to Consider</h3><p>When shopping for a private student loan, the main factors you&#39;ll be comparing across lenders are:</p><ul><li><strong>Interest rates &mdash;</strong> Unlike federal student loans, which have fixed interest rates set by the federal government, private student loans come with fixed rates that are generally higher, or variable rates that can change. You&#39;ll want to find the lowest interest rate possible, and consider the risk of choosing a variable rate that could go up in the future.</li><li><strong>Fees &mdash;</strong> Some private student loan lenders tack on extra charges like origination fees when you open a loan or late payment penalties. Look for a lender with as few fees as possible.</li><li><strong>Term lengths &mdash;</strong> Make sure you choose a lender with repayment term lengths that work for you. Some lenders will choose the term length for you, while others offer a variety of options. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/do-student-loans-affect-credit-scores">Student loans can affect your credit score</a>, potentially lowering it significantly, if you are late or skip payments, so you&#39;ll want to pick a repayment term that works with your monthly budget.</li><li><strong>Repayment options &mdash;</strong> Look for a private student loan lender that has a variety of repayment options. For example, the best private student loan lenders offer the ability to defer payments until after you graduate.</li></ul><h3>Comparing Interest Rates and Terms</h3><p>Remember that the best private student loan for you will depend on your credit score, with higher credit scores generally qualifying for lower interest rates.</p><p>Pay close attention to term lengths, too, since shorter term lengths will entail larger monthly payments. This is a great way to save on interest, but you&#39;ll need to evaluate your budget to see whether you can afford it.</p><p>Make sure to compare offers with several lenders before making a final decision.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to Apply">Applying for a Private Student Loan</h2><p>Unlike with federal student loans, which require filling out the FAFSA, you can apply for private student loans directly through a given lender. But you&#39;ll need to make sure you&#39;re eligible to apply first.</p><h3>Eligibilty Requirements</h3><p>Generally, to get a private student loan you must:</p><ul><li>Be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, a temporary resident with an eligible co-signer, or have DACA status</li><li>Be enrolled at least half-time in a school that is part of the lender&#39;s network</li><li>Meet certain income requirements</li><li>Pass a credit check or apply with a co-signer who can&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Required Documents</h3><p>To apply for a private student loan, you&#39;ll typically need to provide the following:</p><ul><li>Your Social Security card</li><li>Your school of enrollment and area of study</li><li>The loan amount you need</li><li>Personal information including your address, phone number, and income history</li></ul><h3>Application Process</h3><p>You can apply for a private student loan via a lender&#39;s website. Navigate to the application section, where you&#39;ll be asked to fill in information such as the items above.</p><p>After you complete the initial application, you&#39;ll generally see your prequalified rates and an approval decision. Generally the results will include various options with a range of monthly payments.</p><p>From there, choose the option that works best for you, and sign the paperwork. Once you officially sign the paperwork for the loan, your funds will arrive within a matter of days or weeks.</p><h2>Benefits and Drawbacks of Private Student Loans</h2><h3>Advantages</h3><ul><li><strong>Variable rates &mdash;</strong> Unlike federal student loans, private loans often come with variable rates rather than fixed rates. Sometimes, the variable rates start lower than rates on federal loans, but keep in mind that variable rates can change at any time.</li><li><strong>No origination fees with most lenders &mdash;</strong> While some private student loan servicers, such as MPower Financing, do charge origination fees, the majority do not. With federal student loans, expect to pay an origination fee.</li></ul><h3>Disadvantages</h3><ul><li><strong>Fewer options for loan forgiveness &mdash;</strong> Federal loans come with more opportunities for forgiveness, while with personal student loans you&#39;ll get short term relief at most.</li><li><strong>Need high credit score to qualify for the best rates &mdash;</strong> To save on interest rates, you&#39;ll need an excellent credit score or to apply with a co-signer with a high score.</li><li><strong>Interest starts accruing while you&#39;re in school &mdash;</strong> Some federal student loans don&#39;t accrue interest while you&#39;re studying, but that&#39;s not the case with private student loans.</li><li><strong>Higher rates in general &mdash;</strong> Overall, private student loans charge higher interest rates than federal ones, and this is especially true with fixed rates.</li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Private Student Loan FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>What is a private student loan?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">A private student loan is a student loan offered through a private loan company rather than the federal government. Private student loans generally have less favorable terms than federal loans, so you should prioritize any federal loan options first and then consider private loans for any gap in funding.</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Who can apply for a private student loan?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Students can apply for a private student loan either on their own or with a co-signer. The private student loan applciation process usually requires a credit check, so if you don&#39;t have an established credit history, you may need a co-signer to qualify.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How do interest rates on private student loans work?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Private student loan interest rates can be either fixed or variable. The higher your credit score, the lower your rate should be.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Can I refinance my private student loans?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, you can refinance your private student loans with most lenders, and it could be worth it if you&#39;re able to reduce your loan interest rate or adjust the repayment terms.</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Is it a good idea to take out a private student loan?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Whether or not it&#39;s a good idea to take out a private student loan depends on your unique financial situation. You may consider alternatives such as a less expensive school, scholarships, or a side job to earn more money. Whatever your decision is, make sure you understand the terms of your loan before making a choice.</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>What are the repayment options for private student loans?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">While private student loan repayment options vary from lender to lender, in general the options include immediate repayment, interest-only payments while you&#39;re in school, and defering payments until after you graduate.</p><h2 id="experts&#39;-advice-on-choosing-the-best-debt-consolidation-loan-for-you">Our Experts&#39; Advice on Choosing the Best Private Student Loan</h2><p>We consulted the following loan and financial experts to give their insights into finding the best low-interest student loans for your needs.</p><ul><li>Sean August, CEO at <a href="https://app.qwoted.com/companies/https-www-augustwmg-com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The August Wealth Management Group</a></li><li>Ryan Wangman, former loans reporter at Personal Finance Insider<a href="https://app.qwoted.com/companies/https-www-augustwmg-com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></li></ul><h3><strong>How should I determine how much to borrow through a student loan?</strong></h3><p><strong>Sean August:</strong></p><p>&#34;The loan amount should be high enough to cover your education expenses, but not so high that you borrow more than you can afford to repay.&#34;</p><p><strong>Ryan Wangman:</strong></p><p>&#34;Look at the total cost of your education, and subtract any &#39;gift aid&#39; you&#39;ll receive, like scholarships or grants. Then, consider how much of the remaining money you&#39;ll need to take out in loans to afford the cost of school.&#34;</p><h3><strong>How do the best private student loan rates compare with other loan rates?</strong></h3><p><strong>Sean August:</strong></p><p>&#34;The best private student loans should have lower interest rates compared to credit cards and personal loans. Competitive interest rates will ensure that you don&#39;t pay more than you need to over the life of your loan.&#34;</p><p><strong>Ryan Wangman:</strong></p><p>&#34;The best private student loans will have rates in the single digits, especially for borrowers with great credit. Rates on student loans are usually lower than the rates on credit cards or personal loans.&#34;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us">Why You Should Trust Us: How We Picked the Best Private Student Loans</h2><p>We rate all student loan products in our reviews and guides on a 1-5 scale. The overall rating is a weighted average that takes into account seven different categories, some of which are judged more heavily than others. They are:</p><ul><li>Interest rate (20% of rating)</li><li>Fees (20% of rating)</li><li>Term lengths (15% of rating)</li><li>Repayment options while in school (15% of rating)</li><li>Borrower accessibility (15% of rating)</li><li>Customer support (7.5% of rating)</li><li>Ethics (7.5% of rating)</li></ul><p>Each category&#39;s weighting is determined based on its importance to your borrowing experience. Rates and fees have the most significant impact on the total cost of your loan, so we weigh those the most heavily. Customer support and ethics are still crucial parts of the borrowing experience, but do not directly tie to a student loan&#39;s terms, so they have less of an impact on the overall rating.</p><p><a href="https://app.qwoted.com/companies/https-www-augustwmg-com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><strong><strong><strong>Read more about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/how-we-rate-student-loans" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="567c62e4f3f1ace3a3e77a317f701ac9" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-we-rate-student-loans">how we rate student loans Â»</a></strong></strong></strong></p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/best-private-student-loans">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

Low credit scores and spotty credit histories can indicate the opposite.</p><p>For these reasons, it may be difficult to qualify for loans without a good credit score. If you can qualify, lenders may give you a higher-than-average rate to compensate for the extra risk.</p><p>Fortunately, it&#39;s not impossible to get a student loan with bad credit. For one, there are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/federal-vs-private-student-loans">federal student loans</a>, which don&#39;t consider credit when determining eligibility or setting rates. You can also look for lenders that offer loan programs for lower-credit borrowers, or you can bring in a cosigner &mdash; one with a strong credit profile &mdash; on your loan application.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/cosigner-vs-coborrower-difference">Cosigners</a> agree to legally share the responsibility for your loan and will need to make payments if you fail to. This offers extra protection for lenders and can make it easier to qualify for a student loan. In some cases, it may mean a lower interest rate, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Shopping around for your student loan lender can help, too. Do your research and compare several companies on eligibility requirements, loan amounts, interest rates, repayment terms, grace periods, and even hardship options. These can protect you if you&#39;re ever struggling financially and cannot make payments.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Can I get a student loan with a cosigner if I have bad credit?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, you can probably find a student loan lender to borrow from if you apply with a more creditworthy cosigner. Remember that the cosigner will be required to take over payments if you can&#39;t cover them.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Can I get a student loan with no credit with a cosigner?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Some private student loan lenders will approve you even if you have no credit score if you have a cosigner who agrees to share in the responsibility of the loan. The cosigner will have to have good credit.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Can you get a student loan with no credit score?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, you can get a student loan with no credit score. Some lenders may require you to apply with a creditworthy cosigner, while some may not. Cosigners agree to share in the legal responsibility of the loan and must take over payments if you fail to make them.</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Can you get a student loan with a 500 credit score?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">You may be able to get a student loan with a 500 credit score if you bring in a cosigner on your loan application. Cosigners agree to make payments if you fail to, and they generally need to have good credit to qualify. Many students chose parents, grandparents, siblings, or spouses as their cosigners.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us">Why You Should Trust Us: How We Picked the Best Student Loans For Bad Credit</h2><p>Business Insider&#39;s goal is to help smart people make the best possible decisions with their money. To do that, we combed through many student loans, comparing interest rates, terms, and fine print so you don&#39;t have to.</p><p>We rate all student loan products in our reviews and guides on a 1-5 scale. The overall rating is a weighted average that takes into account seven different categories, some of which are judged more heavily than others. They are:</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Interest rate (20% of rating)</li><li aria-level="1">Fees (20% of rating)</li><li aria-level="1">Term lengths (15% of rating)</li><li aria-level="1">Repayment options while in school (15% of rating)</li><li aria-level="1">Borrower accessibility (15% of rating)</li><li aria-level="1">Customer support (7.5% of rating)</li><li aria-level="1">Ethics (7.5% of rating)</li></ul><p>Each category&#39;s weighting is determined based on its importance to your borrowing experience. Rates and fees have the biggest impact on the total cost of your loan, so we weigh those the most heavily. Customer support and ethics are still crucial parts of the borrowing experience but do not directly tie to a student loan&#39;s terms, so they have less of an impact on the overall rating.</p><p><strong><em>Read more about </em></strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-we-rate-student-loans"><strong><em>how we rate student loans</em></strong></a><strong><em> &gt;&gt;</em></strong></p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/bad-credit-student-loans">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

Membership at SoFi is free.</p><h3>Autopay Discounts</h3><p>If you&#39;re willing to put your account on autopay, you can get 0.25% knocked off your interest rate. This would take an interest rate of 10% and bring it down to 9.75%, saving you significantly on interest over time.</p><h3>Continuing Scholar Discount</h3><p>If you take out a subsequental year&#39;s loan you can qualify for a 0.125% discount.</p><h3>Family Discount</h3><p>Cosigners who sign for a second borrower qualify that loan for a 0.125% discount.</p><h3>Student Loan Refinancing</h3><p>You can also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/how-to-refinance-student-loan">refinance student loans</a> that you already have through SoFi. This could help change your loan term, pay off your loan faster, or consolidate your loans into one existing one.&nbsp;</p><h3>Loan Term Options</h3><p>SoFi offers four distinct term options for its student loans. You can opt for five-, seven-, 10-, or 15-year terms. There are no penalties for paying your loan off before this point, though.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Rates and Fees">SoFi Student Loan Interest Rates and Fees</h2><p>A loan&#39;s rates and terms will play a big role in your monthly payment and how much you pay to finance your education in the long haul. Here&#39;s what to know about SoFi&#39;s:&nbsp;</p><h3>Fixed vs. Variable Rates</h3><p>SoFi offers both fixed and variable-rate student loans. The undergraduate rates are 5.79% - 15.86% variable and 3.99% - 14.83% fixed (with AutoPay discount) while the graduate rates are 5.79% - 15.86% variable and 3.99% - 14.83% fixed (with AutoPay discount).</p><p>With fixed rates, your interest rate remains the same for the entire loan term. Variable rates can change over the course of your loan, changing your monthly payment with them.</p><h2>SoFi Student Loan Repayment Options and Flexibility</h2><p>You have four options to repay your SoFi student loan after you&#39;ve taken it out: deferred, partial, interest-only, and immediate payment. Each option has its advantages for different types of borrowers.&nbsp;</p><h3>In-School Payment Options</h3><p>If you&#39;re able to make payments in school, you can choose partial, interest-only, and immediate payments.&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#39;s how the three compare:</p><p><strong>Partial</strong></p><ul><li aria-level="1">Unpaid interest accrues</li><li aria-level="1">Low in-school payments</li><li aria-level="1">Reduces some of overall cost</li></ul><p><strong>Interest-Only</strong></p><ul><li aria-level="1">Pay loan&#39;s interest monthly while in school</li><li aria-level="1">Moderate in-school payments</li><li aria-level="1">Reduces overall cost</li></ul><p><strong>Immediate</strong></p><ul><li aria-level="1">Repay principal plus interest right away</li><li aria-level="1">Lowest overall cost</li><li aria-level="1">Highest in-school payments</li></ul><p>Immediate payments are the least expensive option because by paying down your debt in full monthly payments right away, there&#39;s less time for interest to accrue on your loan.&nbsp;</p><h3>Grace Periods and Deferment Options</h3><p>You can also defer payment to avoid paying the loan back until after graduation. Deferred payments are the most expensive option because you&#39;re not paying off anything during your time in school, so your balance (and interest) will continue to grow until you graduate and start making payments. You can also defer payments if you enter active military service or become disabled.</p><p>SoFi also offers payment-free grace periods for up to six months on all student loans &mdash; including refinanced ones.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Pros and Cons&nbsp;">SoFi Student Loans Pros and Cons&nbsp;</h2><p>If you&#39;re considering SoFi for a private student loan, make sure you weigh these pros and cons first.</p><h3><strong>Advantages of Choosing SoFi</strong></h3><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Highly competitive APRs.</strong> SoFi&#39;s student loan rates are some of the best you can find, particularly if you have great credit.&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Multiple repayment term lengths.</strong> Choose between five, seven, 10, and 15-year repayment term lengths.&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>No fees.</strong> You won&#39;t be hit with any fees when you take out a loan with SoFi, saving you a good chunk of money on the overall cost of your loan.&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Quick application process.</strong> It&#39;ll only take a few minutes to get a student loan from SoFi.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>Potential Drawbacks</strong></h3><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Credit check required.</strong> This hard inquiry could ding your credit score slightly in the short term.</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Loan terms max out at 15 years.</strong> Some other lenders offer 20-year loans or longer.</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Processing times are lengthy.</strong> SoFi says it can take up to six weeks to fund its student loans.</li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="How to Apply">SoFi Student Loan Application Process&nbsp;</h2><p>SoFi offers an easy online application process that you can complete in just minutes. Here&#39;s what the process looks like:</p><ol><li>Gather required information. This includes your Social Security number, your school of enrollment, your enrollment status, the loan amount you need, your address, and other financial documents.</li><li>Fill in the details of your online application. After doing so, you&#39;ll get your rates.&nbsp;</li><li>Send the required supplementary documents. SoFi may require certain financial documents including proof of income and residency.&nbsp;</li><li>Accept your loan offer. After you get all your documents in order, SoFi will send you a formal loan agreement. SoFi will fund your loan after you sign on the dotted line.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>In addition to basic requirements like being a U.S. citizen enrolled in a degree-granting school half-time or more, you will also need to meet the following:</p><h3>Credit Score and Income Requirements</h3><p>You&#39;ll need to pass a credit check, but SoFi doesn&#39;t disclose exactly what scores you&#39;ll need to qualify for its loan programs. You or your cosigner will also need to be employed or have enough income from other sources to afford your monthly payments for the entirety of the loan term.</p><h3>Qualify with a Cosigner</h3><p>If you&#39;re worried about qualifying for a loan on your own, you can bring in a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/cosigner-vs-coborrower-difference">cosigner</a>. The lender then considers the cosigner&#39;s credit and income when evaluating your loan application. SoFi also allows you to request a cosigner release if you meet certain conditions.</p><h2 data-toc-label="SoFi Student Loan Alternatives"><strong>SoFi Student Loan Alternatives</strong></h2><p>See how SoFi Student Loans stack up against the competition.</p><h3><strong>SoFi Student Loans vs. College Ave Student Loans</strong></h3><p>If you have good credit, you may get a marginally better fixed APR with College Ave than with SoFi, as College Ave has a lower minimum rate.</p><p>However, if your credit isn&#39;t in the best shape, SoFi&#39;s maximum interest rate is lower than what you could pay with College Ave. SoFi won&#39;t charge any late fees, while College Ave may penalize you up to $25 for a delayed payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/student-loans/college-ave-student-loans-review"><em>College Ave Student Loan Review</em></a></p><h3><strong>SoFi Student Loans vs. Sallie Mae Student Loans</strong></h3><p>SoFi has a significantly lower minimum and maximum fixed APR than Sallie Mae Undergraduate Student Loans.

It rates 4.5 stars out of 5 on Trustpilot, and its mobile apps are also highly rated, indicating they&#39;re easy to use and navigate. Keep in mind SoFi offers multiple products and services beyond student loans, so not all customer reviews relate to student loans specifically.</p><h3>Is SoFi Trustworthy?</h3><p>The company is considered trustworthy, too, boasting an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. This means it&#39;s good at responding to complaints and communicating with customers.</p><p>There are no major lawsuits pending against the company, though SoFi <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/will-sofi-win-lawsuit-end-student-loan-payment-pause-borrowers-2023-3">did attempt to sue the Department of Education last year</a> to end the student loan payment freeze post-pandemic.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us"><strong>Why You Should Trust Us: How We Rated SoFi Student Loans</strong></h2><p>We rate all student loan products in our reviews and guides on a 1-5 scale.

Bonuses also help create a distinction between competing banks that may offer similar interest rates, monthly fees, or opening deposit requirements.</p><p>Current bank account promotion offers range from $50 to $4,000. Generally, brick-and-mortar banks are more likely to offer bank account bonuses to new customers than online banks or banking platforms.</p><p>In addition to the tips mentioned below, make sure you qualify to open a bank account at a specific financial institution. You typically need a U.S. ID and Social Security number to apply for an account. However, if you are unbanked because you don&#39;t have a U.S. ID, know that you have options. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/banks-credit-unions-for-immigrants-non-us-citizens" rel="" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="60" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/banks-credit-unions-for-immigrants-non-us-citizens">top banks for immigrants and non-U.S. Citizens</a>&nbsp;allow you to provide a foreign passport or Matricula Consular to open a bank account.&nbsp;</p><h3>How to Qualify for Bank Signup Bonuses</h3><p>To qualify for a bank account bonus, you must apply through a bank promotional page or use a special code to open a bank account through a bank representative.</p><p>Each financial institution will also list certain requirements you must meet by a specified timeframe. You might need to make a direct deposit or transfer, maintain a specific daily balance, and/or enroll in online banking to get the bonus.</p><p>Once you&#39;ve completed all the requirements specified by the bank, the bonus will be deposited into your account. You&#39;ll also need to keep your bank account open for a certain time period to keep the bonus and avoid paying an early account closure fee.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Promotions for Existing Customers">Promotions for Existing Customers</h2><p>A few financial institutions, like Chase and SoFiÂ®, have bank account bonuses for existing customers. Banks typically offer existing customers bank promotions when they want you to upgrade to a premium bank account with higher minimum balance requirements or utilize a specific banking feature. For example, you might be asked to set up <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/direct-deposit">direct deposits</a>.</p><p>Remember, though, that most bonus promotions are for new bank account customers. Some banks will still let you qualify as a new customer if you&#39;ve opened a bank account with them in the past, but they&#39;ll list a specific time that needs to have passed.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to Choose the Best Checking Account Bonus Offer">How to Choose the Best Checking Account Bonus Offer</h2><p>Evaluating the best bank promotion deals requires more than simply checking the bonus requirements. After all, you want to make sure that your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/open-new-bank-account-cash-bonus">bank account bonus is worth it</a> and that the account actually fits your needs.</p><p>Here are three steps you can take to choose the best bank bonus offer.</p><h3>1. Compare bonus values and requirements from similar financial institutions.</h3><p>Think about which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/types-of-checking-accounts" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="20" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/types-of-checking-accounts">types of checking account</a> you want and where you want to get it. Do you want a traditional checking account at a brick-and-mortar bank or a rewards checking account from an online bank? Are looking for an everyday banking option that has minimal maintenance requirements, or do you want to get a premium bank account that offers more rewards for maintaining a high account balance?</p><p>Once you&#39;ve narrowed down your options, review a couple of institutions to see if bonuses are available. For example, you&#39;ll likely find several offers if you want a traditional checking account with a national brick-and-mortar bank. You can compare the requirements and cash bonus values and see if there&#39;s a standout option.</p><h3>2. Review the bank account for common bank fees.</h3><p>You don&#39;t want to open a bank account at a financial institution where you&#39;ll have to pay exorbitant bank fees because it isn&#39;t a good fit. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/how-to-avoid-bank-fees">Common bank fees</a> you&#39;ll find include monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, ATM fees, and early account closure fees.</p><p>Make sure you meet the requirements to waive fees on your account. Otherwise, you might be better off getting a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-free-checking-accounts">free checking account</a>, so you can properly maintain your account without facing common bank charges.</p><h3>3. Consider your long-term goals and see if the bank&#39;s overall products and services are a good fit.</h3><p>In addition to reviewing bank account fees, assess other bank accounts and services. If you&#39;re looking to buy a home or open a credit card soon, it may be worthwhile to check out a bank to see if it could be a good option for future goals.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Tips for Maximizing Checking Account Bonuses">Tips for Maximizing Checking Account Bonuses</h2><p>Here are tips you can use to maximize a bank account bonus:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep track of offer deadlines. </strong>For bank account bonuses with tiered cash bonuses, make sure you review the requirements carefully to make sure you meet the specific requirements by the specified timeframe. For example, if you have to transfer in the first 60 days, take into account that ACH transfers take a few business days to process.</li><li><strong>Understanding the fine print. </strong>Many bonuses often list several requirements you&#39;ll need to fulfill to get a bonus. The fine print on the promotional page will dive into these requirements further and tell you if there are any limits or specifications you should be aware of. For instance, a bank may tell you you&#39;ll get a bonus when you make an eligible direct deposit. You&#39;ll need to review the fine print to see which type of direct deposit is eligible.</li><li><strong>Call customer support if you need help understanding the requirements. </strong>If you aren&#39;t sure whether you can get a bonus, check in with a bank representative to clarify the bonus rules.</li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us">Why You Should Trust Us: Experts&#39; Advice on the Best Checking Account Bonuses</h2><p>We consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best bank account bonus for your needs.</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Sophia Acevedo, banking editor, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance" rel="" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance">Business Insider</a></li><li aria-level="1">Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor, <a href="https://www.boujiebudgets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-mrf-link="https://www.boujiebudgets.com/">BoujieBudgets.com</a></li></ul><p>Here&#39;s what they had to say about bank account bonuses.

Diamond tier members could get a 0.250% reduction of their mortgage rate.&nbsp;</p><h3>Affordable Lender for First-Time and Low-Income Buyers</h3><p>Bank of America has multiple homebuyer assistance programs available, including generous down payment and closing cost grants.&nbsp;</p><h3>Not a Great Choice if You&#39;re Looking for a Less Common Type of Mortgage</h3><p>This lender&#39;s loan offerings should meet most borrowers&#39; needs, but if you need a more niche type of mortgage, you&#39;ll likely need to look elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to Apply">Bank of America Mortgage Application Process</h2><p>To apply for a mortgage with Bank of America, you have the option to get started online, over the phone, or in person if you live near a branch.</p><p><strong>Prequalification and Preapproval Process</strong></p><p>If you&#39;re already under contract on a house, you&#39;ll apply for regular approval. If you&#39;re just looking to understand how much you can afford to borrow, Bank of America offers both prequalification and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/mortgage-preapproval">preapproval</a>. All of these processes can be done online.</p><p>Prequalification takes less time since you won&#39;t need to provide as much information. You&#39;ll be asked about your income, assets, and how much you plan to put toward your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/how-much-down-payment-for-a-house">down payment</a>. Your credit will also be checked.</p><p>With a preapproval, the lender will request <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/documents-needed-for-mortgage-application">documentation</a> showing how much you earn and what you have saved up. This will help them give you a more concrete estimate of how much you can borrow.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Typical Customer Experiences">Typical Customer Experiences With Bank of America Mortgage</h2><p>Business Insider looked at positive and negative customer reviews, online forums, BBB complaints, and other sources to understand what borrowers think about Bank of America&#39;s mortgage lending experience.</p><h3>Bank of America Mortgage Customer Reviews Are Largely Positive, but Some Borrowers Have Issues With Large Lenders</h3><p>Overall, previous borrowers who got their mortgages from Bank of America had positive things to say about their experience. Many reviewers said that the loan officers they worked with were helpful and communicative. Some also noted that Bank of America offered them great rates. This lender also ranked high in J.D. Power&#39;s Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study, which measures customer satisfaction.</p><p>But we also saw a few complaints of poor communication, frustrating customer service, and delays in the process. Bank of America was the 16th largest mortgage lender in the U.S. in 2022, according to a <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_data-point-mortgage-market-activity-trends_report_2023-09.pdf">CFPB report</a>. With a larger mortgage lender, you might not always get the smoothest customer experience. This isn&#39;t always the case, and it&#39;s also possible to have a better experience with a large lender compared to a smaller, local one.</p><p>If you&#39;re worried about getting the attention you need or you want to be sure your lender takes a personalized approach to your mortgage, you might want to check out some local lenders or credit unions. But the vast majority of comments we looked at regarding the mortgage experience at Bank of America were positive.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How Bank of America Compares">How Bank of America Mortgages Compare</h2><h3>Bank of America vs. Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/fairway-independent-mortgage-corporation-review">Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation</a> stands out in customer satisfaction. The lender ranked No. 1 in J.D. Power&#39;s 2023 satisfaction study and has great customer reviews on its Zillow lender page.</p><p>Fairway has a few loan options that Bank of America doesn&#39;t, including USDA loans, reverse mortgages, and renovation loans. But unlike Bank of America, it doesn&#39;t offer a HELOC.</p><p>Fairway offers a $7,000 grant to first-time homebuyers in eligible areas, though you might be able to qualify for a larger amount of assistance with Bank of America. Both lenders are good options for new buyers, though Bank of America was our top pick for the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/best-mortgage-lenders-first-time-buyers">best mortgage lenders for first-time buyers</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/fairway-independent-mortgage-corporation-review">Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation Review</a></p><h3>Bank of America vs. Rocket Mortgage</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/rocket-mortgage-review">Rocket Mortgage</a> is another good choice for both first-time and repeat homebuyers. With Rocket, eligible borrowers can get a mortgage with just 1% down through its ONE+ mortgage program, or a lender credit up to $7,500 with the Purchase Plus program.&nbsp;</p><p>Rocket Mortgage also has a highly convenient online application and offers underwritten preapproval, which can help you stand out when you&#39;re making offers on homes. If a simple approval process is important to you, you might prefer Rocket Mortgage over Bank of America. Rocket also has home equity loans.&nbsp;</p><p>But Rocket&#39;s rates and fees are around average, while Bank of America has low average overall costs.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/rocket-mortgage-review">Rocket Mortgage Review</a></p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Bank of American Mortgage FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">How long does it take to close a mortgage with Bank of America?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The timeline varies for each person, but from the time you make an offer to closing, it typically takes around 45 days.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are Bank of America&#39;s mortgage rates competitive?</h3><p class="faq-answer">In our review of HMDA data, we found that Bank of America&#39;s mortgage average rates were on the low end compared to other lenders.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">How is Bank of America&#39;s customer service for mortgages?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Bank of America earned the No. 5 spot in J.D.

Lenders get higher ratings if they offer a large number of loan types with affordable features, have positive customer reviews, and don&#39;t have any recent public controversies.<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/state-mortgage-rates#alabama-mortgage-calculator-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><br/><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/state-mortgage-rates#alabama-mortgage-calculator-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/bank-of-america-mortgage-review">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not only can the lines take forever, but invasive bag searches and going through the body scanning machine can start off your trip on the wrong foot.</p><p>Savvy travelers take advantage of TSA PreCheckÂ® at participating airports to expedite their path through airport security and&nbsp;get to their flight (or an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/credit-cards-with-airport-lounge-access">airport lounge</a>) more quickly. Not only does this program offer shorter wait times, but travelers can keep their shoes and belts on while also leaving their laptops and liquids in their bags.</p><p>Learn more about TSA PreCheckÂ® in our comprehensive guide, including where you can use it, how to apply, how much it costs, and which credit cards reimburse application fees.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Benefits of TSA PreCheck"><strong>TSA PreCheck Benefits</strong></h2><p>More than 200 U.S. airports now offer expedited security lanes for TSA PreCheckÂ® members.</p><p>TSA PreCheckÂ® membership offers travelers a faster and smoother experience when going through airport security. It&#39;s ideal for frequent flyers, families traveling together, and anyone else who wants a better way to start their flight.</p><h3><strong>Faster Security Lines</strong></h3><p>Travelers with TSA PreCheckÂ® can use dedicated screening lanes at participating airports that typically move more quickly than standard screening lanes.</p><p>On average, TSA PreCheckÂ® lanes get travelers through airport security in less than 10 minutes, while standard screening lanes take up to 30 minutes. Saving 20 minutes at airport security can mean the difference between making your flight and getting left at the gate.</p><p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) also offers the MyTSA app (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mytsa/id380200364?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a>,<a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.dhs.tsa.mytsa&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Google</a>) where you can check airport security wait times, confirm which items you can bring through security, and get other questions answered.</p><h3><strong>Streamlined Screening Process</strong></h3><p>TSA PreCheckÂ®&nbsp; screening lines have shorter wait times on average, and they&#39;re more convenient for travelers as well. Since travelers don&#39;t have to remove clothing or items from their bags, they tend to get through security much faster than other passengers.</p><p>Members can keep shoes, belts, and light jackets on when going through the scanners. Additionally, they can leave laptops and 3-1-1 liquids in their carry-on bags. Keeping your clothes on and items in your bag leads to a more efficient and less stressful security experience, especially if you&#39;re rushing to make your flight.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How Much Does TSA PreCheck Cost?"><strong>TSA PreCheck Cost and Renewal</strong></h2><p>The cost of&nbsp;TSA PreCheckÂ®depends on which provider you apply through. You&#39;ll also save money if you renew online.</p><h3><strong>Membership Cost</strong></h3><p>All TSA PreCheckÂ® memberships last for five years, no matter which provider you apply through. The cost for each five-year period is:</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><a href="https://tsaprecheckbyclear.tsa.dhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLEAR</a></li><ul><li aria-level="2">New membership $77.95</li><li aria-level="2">Renewal online $68.95</li><li aria-level="2">Renewal in-person $77.95</li></ul><li aria-level="1"><a href="https://tsaenrollmentbyidemia.tsa.dhs.gov/programs/precheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEMIA</a></li><ul><li aria-level="2">New membership $78</li><li aria-level="2">Renewal online $70</li><li aria-level="2">Renewal in-person $78</li></ul><li><a href="https://tsaprecheckbytelos.tsa.dhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telos</a></li><ul><li aria-level="2">New membership $85</li><li aria-level="2">Renewal online $70</li><li aria-level="2">Renewal in-person $70</li></ul></ul><p>Memberships can be renewed online up to six months before expiration. Starting early ensures you&#39;ll continue receiving TSA PreCheckÂ® benefits at the airport, even if the application process takes longer than expected.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to Get Free TSA PreCheck"><strong>How to Get TSA PreCheck for Free or at a Discount</strong></h2><p>TSA PreCheckÂ® benefits are a bargain at $17 or less a year when you spread the cost out over five years. However, you can bring the cost down even lower by taking advantage of programs that reduce or eliminate the expense altogether.</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Credit card benefits</strong>: Many of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-travel-rewards-credit-cards">best travel rewards credit cards</a>, like the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-sapphire-reserve-credit-card-review">Chase Sapphire Reserve</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/capital-one-venture-vs-ventureone">Capital One Venture Card</a>, offer a statement credit to cover the application fee. You can pay TSA PreCheckÂ® application fees for anyone; this reimbursement benefit is not limited to the cardholder alone. Check out our full guide to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-global-entry-tsa-precheck-credit-card">best credit&nbsp;cards with Global Entry and TSA PreCheck</a> to learn more.</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Loyalty programs</strong>: Some airline or hotel loyalty programs offer discounts or points redemptions for TSA PreCheckÂ®. For example, you can redeem 11,000 United miles or 25,000 Marriott points to cover application fees.</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Employer reimbursement</strong>: Companies may cover application fees for employees who travel regularly on company business. Check if your employer offers reimbursement for TSA PreCheckÂ® as a travel benefit.</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Global Entry</strong>: If you apply for Global Entry, it includes TSA PreCheckÂ® for approved members at no extra cost. Global Entry application fees are $120 for five years.</li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="How to Get TSA PreCheck"><strong>TSA PreCheck Eligibility and Application Process</strong></h2><p>If you want to get TSA PreCheckÂ®, the process is fairly straightforward: Apply online, pay a non-refundable application fee, undergo a background check, and complete an in-person interview.</p><h3><strong>How to Enroll in TSA PreCheck</strong></h3><p>Here&#39;s how to sign up and conduct your interview.</p><ol><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ol><li aria-level="1">Visit the <a href="https://ttp.dhs.gov/">Trusted Traveler Program</a> page</li><li aria-level="1">Click &#34;Get Started&#34; under the TSA PreCheck banner</li><li aria-level="1">Click &#34;Apply Now&#34; through one of three official providers &ndash; <a href="https://tsaprecheckbyclear.tsa.dhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLEAR</a>, <a href="https://tsaenrollmentbyidemia.tsa.dhs.gov/programs/precheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEMIA</a>, or <a href="https://tsaprecheckbytelos.tsa.dhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telos</a></li><li aria-level="1">Provide all required personal information to complete your application</li><li aria-level="1">Wait for approval</li><li aria-level="1">Visit an enrollment center to:<br/>&nbsp;<ul><li aria-level="1">pay your application fees</li><li aria-level="1">undergo the interview</li><li aria-level="1">get fingerprinted</li><li aria-level="1">provide identification documents</li><li aria-level="1">get an official photo taken</li></ul></li><li aria-level="1">Upon approval, receive your Known Traveler Number (KTN)</li></ol></li></ol><p>Most applicants are approved within three to five business days. However, some cases may require additional review, and can take up to 60 days for approval. About 90% of applicants are approved for membership.</p><p>You can expedite your application by scheduling an online appointment or by calling (855) 347-8371. Additionally, you can apply through CLEAR and conduct your interview without requiring an appointment.</p><p>After receiving your TSA PreCheckÂ® KTN, add it to your existing flight reservations and airline loyalty program profiles. Most airlines automatically apply your KTN to new reservations if you&#39;ve added the number to your profile.</p><p>You cannot use TSA PreCheckÂ® security lanes if your reservation and boarding pass don&#39;t reflect your KTN. If you notice that your boarding pass doesn&#39;t specify &#34;TSA Pre&#34;, you can go to the airline check-in desk and have an agent add your KTN for you.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Avoiding TSA PreCheck Scams</strong></h2><p>Some scammers use official-seeming TSA PreCheckÂ® enrollment websites to lure&nbsp;travelers into paying extra money or revealing their personal information. Note the following tips to avoid getting scammed:</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Go to the right website &mdash; </strong>When searching for TSA PreCheck application pages, confirm that the website ends in &#34;.gov&#34; instead of .com or other URLs.</li><li><strong>How much are you paying? &mdash; </strong>The official Trusted Traveler Program website lists the exact price range for <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/precheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSA PreCheck enrollment</a> across the three official providers. If you are asked to pay more than that, you&#39;re not signing up through an official provider.&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Is the website secure?</strong> &mdash; Seek out websites with the SSL mark in your browser search bar. This encryption makes it harder for scammers to steal data that you&#39;re transmitting.</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Avoid clicking on links &mdash;</strong> Instead of clicking on links through Google, type in the website URL you want to visit.</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Use a virtual credit card number &mdash;</strong>&nbsp;Virtual credit cards provide temporary card numbers that can only be used once or at a specific vendor. Some also limit how much can be spent. If someone steals the card number and attempts an unauthorized transaction, it will be declined.</li></ul><h2><strong>Are You Eligible for TSA PreCheck?</strong></h2><p>TSA PreCheckÂ® is available for U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Citizens of partner countries enrolled in Global Entry, NEXUS, or SENTRI, and Canadian citizens enrolled in NEXUS are also eligible to participate in TSA PreCheck.</p><p>Parents with TSA PreCheckÂ® can bring children 12 and under through security without restriction. Children ages 13 through 17 must have their own TSA PreCheckÂ® boarding pass designation and travel on the same airline reservation as the adult they&#39;re traveling with. Any children traveling alone must have their own membership to use the TSA PreCheckÂ® security lanes.</p><p>If you want your child to have their own membership, you must complete a separate application for each child. Effective October 1, 2024, the application fees for children under 18 are waived.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Is TSA PreCheck Worth It?"><strong>Is TSA PreCheck Worth It?</strong></h2><p>TSA PreCheckÂ® membership is definitely worthwhile for frequent travelers and families, while occasional travelers may be persuaded of the value if they have access to discounted or free enrollment.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>User Experiences and Testimonials</strong></h3><p>Travelers who haven&#39;t used TSA PreCheckÂ® before may wonder if the cost and application process are worth their time and money. Our experts checked popular online forums such as Reddit and FlyerTalk to see what everyday travelers have to say about their personal experiences with expedited airport security screening.</p><p>Experiences vary considerably depending on the airports you frequent, your travel times, and how often you fly. With that in mind, we&#39;re highlighting three traveler profiles to determine whether TSA PreCheck is worth it.</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Frequent Travelers</strong>: Frequent flyers say that TSA PreCheckÂ® is definitely worth it for the time and hassle saved. <br/><br/>One Reddit user completed their application and approval process in 72 hours: &#34;I applied for TSA PreCheckÂ® on Monday afternoon, scheduled my in-person &#39;appointment&#39; at a nearby Staples for Wednesday morning, and received my eligibility notice on Thursday afternoon.&#34;</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Occasional Travelers</strong>: If you only travel occasionally, weigh the program&#39;s enrollment against the potential benefits and frequency of travel. If you can get TSA PreCheckÂ® for free, the program may be worth the effort. <br/><br/>One Reddit user commented, &#34;Everyone talks about the shorter lines, but that&#39;s not even the best part. You don&#39;t have to take anything out of your bag and your shoes, belt, and jacket stay on.&#34;</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Families</strong>: TSA PreCheckÂ® can be a game-changer for families, especially those with young children, since children under 18 can use TSA PreCheckÂ® benefits for free when traveling on a reservation with an adult who has a membership. <br/><br/>Reddit members remind other parents that both adults need TSA PreCheck in order for the whole family to utilize expedited security lanes.</li></ul><h2><strong>TSA PreCheck vs. CLEAR</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/clear-airport-security">CLEAR</a> is a private biometric screening service that offers faster security experiences at airports, arenas, stadiums, and other venues. Its proprietary identification service uses fingerprint or retina scanning to verify your identity and expedite members through security.</p><p>The company offers several services including CLEAR Plus and CLEAR Reserve. CLEAR Plus is an annual membership that offers expedited entry at 58 airports nationwide. Meanwhile, CLEAR Reserve is a free service that offers a 20-minute window for expedited service through airport security. CLEAR Reserve is currently available at 13 North American airports, and four airports in Europe.</p><p>Children enrolled in CLEAR Plus can use its kiosks without being accompanied by a registered adult.</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Cost: </strong>$199 per year; $119 each for up to three adults; $0 for children under 18</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Interviews: </strong>Members can sign up online and complete their interview in person, or complete the entire process at a CLEAR kiosk</li></ul><h2><strong>TSA PreCheck vs. Other Expedited Screening Programs</strong></h2><p>Beyond CLEAR, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) operates four other Trusted Traveler programs that travelers can apply for. Each program caters to a different type of traveler based on where and when they travel. Here&#39;s how TSA PreCheckÂ® compares against the other programs:</p><h3><strong>TSA PreCheck vs. Global Entry</strong></h3><p>TSA PreCheck offers dedicated security lanes at the airport before your flight, while <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-global-entry-tsa-precheck-credit-card">Global Entry</a> provides expedited clearance at customs and immigration when returning from an international trip. Adults and children of all ages must have their own Global Entry membership, even if the child is a baby, infant or toddler.</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Cost: </strong>$120 for Global Entry for five years; $0 for minors under the age of 18</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Interviews: </strong>In-person interview at a Global Entry enrollment center or Enrollment on Arrival at 69 participating airports</li></ul><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Global Entry membership includes TSA PreCheckÂ®, so you may be able to get both services for the price of one.</p><h3><strong>TSA PreCheck vs. NEXUS</strong></h3><p>NEXUS grants pre-approved travelers expedited entry when traveling between the U.S. and Canada. This membership can be used at designated northern border ports of entry, marine reporting locations, NEXUS kiosks when entering Canada by air, and Global Entry kiosks when traveling to the U.S. from Canadian preclearance airports.</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Cost</strong>. $120 for NEXUS for five years; $0 for minors under 18</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Interviews</strong>. In-person interviews must be conducted with both Canadian and U.S. officials at a NEXUS enrollment center, or at Enrollment on Arrival at eight participating airports</li></ul><h3><strong>TSA PreCheck vs. SENTRI</strong></h3><p>SENTRI offers dedicated primary lanes into the U.S. for eligible travelers who frequently travel between the U.S. and Mexico. Membership includes one registered vehicle for the SENTRI lane, but you can add up to three more for an additional fee.</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Cost:</strong>&nbsp;$120 for NEXUS for five years; $42 for each additional vehicle</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Interviews:</strong>&nbsp;In-person interviews are available in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas</li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="TSA PreCheck FAQs"><strong>TSA PreCheck Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Can I use TSA PreCheck for international flights?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">TSA PreCheckÂ® members can use fast-track airport security screening lanes on eligible flights at more than 200 U.S. airports. Pairing TSA PreCheck with Global Entry membership expedites travelers through customs and immigration when returning from international travel.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>What if I have a criminal record?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Approval for TSA PreCheckÂ® includes a background check that may uncover disqualifying criminal convictions. False application information or certain violations of federal security regulations may lead to your application being denied or having an existing membership canceled or revoked.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Can I get a refund if my application is denied?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">No. When applying for TSA PreCheckÂ®, the application fees are nonrefundable. Evaluate the application rules to ensure you qualify to avoid an unpleasant surprise. Using a credit card that reimburses TSA PreCheckÂ® application fees ensures you won&#39;t lose money if you&#39;re denied.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How much does PreCheck TSA cost?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">TSA PreCheckÂ® costs between $77.95 to $85 for initial enrollment, or $68 to $78 for renewal, depending on which official provider you use.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>What does having a TSA PreCheck get you?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">TSA PreCheckÂ® allows travelers to utilize the fast lane for airport security screening at more than 200 U.S. airports.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How long does the TSA PreCheck process take?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The TSA PreCheckÂ® application process typically takes three to five business days to complete, and requires an online application as well as a background check, fingerprinting, and an in-person interview.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>I</strong><strong>s it worth getting TSA PreCheck?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">TSA PreCheckÂ® is worthwhile for frequent flyers, families, and anyone with access to free or discounted membership.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why You Should Trust Us: How We Reviewed TSA PreCheck</strong></h2><p>Travelers who want to minimize time and frustration at airport security should consider getting TSA PreCheckÂ®. This Trusted Traveler program provides expedited security lanes and a less intrusive experience when going through security at participating airports. If you qualify and value expedited security screening at the airport, we recommend applying before your next flight.</p><p>Membership lasts five years and is affordable for most travelers, especially if you have a credit card that reimburses the fee or when you redeem travel rewards to cover some or all of the cost. TSA PreCheckÂ® costs less than other programs, including Global Entry and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/clear-airport-security">CLEAR</a>, and families can bring eligible children with them through security for no extra fees.</p><p>We considered many factors when reviewing TSA PreCheckÂ®:</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Value for money</strong> &mdash; How often will enrolled customers use TSA PreCheckÂ®? Does the benefit outweigh the program cost?</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Common praise and complaints</strong> &mdash; What are members saying about their experience using TSA PreCheckÂ®? Does it make sense for individuals as well as families?</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Discounts and credits</strong> &mdash; How often will you be paying full price for membership? Is it possible to get the benefit for less, or even for free?</li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Efficiency</strong> &mdash; Does TSA PreCheckÂ® hold up to its promise of saving you time at the airport and beyond?</li></ul><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/tsa-precheck">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, it&#39;s still well over the national savings account average of 0.46% APY.</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Compare Apple&#39;s Savings Rate to Featured Nationally Available Deposit Rates</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">Open a new bank account or cash management account and earn best-in-class rates.</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 245px;" border="1"><tbody><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 42.493%; height: 22px;">Account Name</td><td style="width: 32.507%; height: 22px;">APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) are accurate as of 10/16/2024</td><td style="width: 25%; height: 22px;">Minimum Account Opening Balance</td></tr><tr style="height: 47px;"><td style="width: 42.493%; height: 47px;">LendingClub LevelUp Savings Account</td><td style="width: 32.507%; height: 47px;">up to 5.30%</td><td style="width: 25%; height: 47px;">$0</td></tr><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 42.493%; height: 22px;">Western Alliance Bank High-Yield Savings Premier</td><td style="width: 32.507%; height: 22px;">4.96%</td><td style="width: 25%; height: 22px;">$500</td></tr><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 42.493%; height: 22px;">BrioDirect High-Yield Savings Account</td><td style="width: 32.507%; height: 22px;">5.05%</td><td style="width: 25%; height: 22px;">$5,000</td></tr><tr style="height: 43px;"><td style="width: 42.493%; height: 43px;">Barclays Tiered Savings</td><td style="width: 32.507%; height: 43px;">up to 4.80%</td><td style="width: 25%; height: 43px;">$0</td></tr><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 42.493%; height: 22px;">CIT Bank Platinum Savings</td><td style="width: 32.507%; height: 22px;">4.70% (with $5,000 minimum balance)</td><td style="width: 25%; height: 22px;">$100</td></tr><tr style="height: 67px;"><td style="width: 42.493%; height: 67px;">SoFi Checking and Savings (Member FDIC)</td><td style="width: 32.507%; height: 67px;">up to 4.30%</td><td style="width: 25%; height: 67px;">$0</td></tr></tbody></table></aside><h2 data-toc-label="Overview">Apple Savings Account Overview</h2><p>While its interest rates are good and it doesn&#39;t charge any monthly service fees or require a minimum opening deposit, the best savings accounts with high interest give better rates. It&#39;s also hampered by its requirements; you have to be an iPhone user with an Apple Card to use it.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How It Works">How Apple Savings Works</h2><h3>Apple Savings Account Setup Process</h3><p>The Apple Savings Account setup process is more complicated than you might expect. Before you open an account, you have to have an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/apple-card-review">Apple Card</a> with a linked iPhone that&#39;s running at iOS 16.4 or later. You&#39;ll also need to be an adult with a physical U.S. address and either a Social Security number or an individual taxpayer identification number.</p><p>When you&#39;re ready to create your Apple Savings Account, you&#39;ll need to go into your Wallet and tap your Apple Card. You&#39;ll press the More button (which looks like three dots in a circle) and tap Daily Cash. From there, you&#39;ll tap the Set Up button next to savings and follow the onscreen instructions. You can choose whether to transfer any Apple Cash when you open your savings account.</p><h3>Apple Savings Earnings</h3><p>If you use the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-cash-back-credit-cards">cash-back credit card</a> features of the Apple Card, you&#39;ll be able to automatically deposit the Daily Cash you earn into your Apple Savings Account, allowing it to earn interest. You can also deposit your Apple Cash balance into your Apple Savings Account. This Apple Savings Account benefit can help you earn a bit of extra interest if you&#39;re already immersed in the Apple ecosystem.</p><h3>Apple Savings Fees and Charges</h3><p>Apple Savings doesn&#39;t charge any monthly service fees, and it doesn&#39;t require a minimum opening deposit. This makes it useful in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/how-to-avoid-bank-fees">avoiding bank fees</a>. It also doesn&#39;t charge you to withdraw money, although it generally takes several days for withdrawals to go through.</p><div class="insider-raw-embed" data-type="embed" data-embed-type="raw" id="23e5e664-24d2-4113-a59f-a9314a2aee90"><script type="application/javascript" src="https://www.moneylion.com/network/business-insider/calculators/web-component/savings-calculator/index.js"></script><moneylion-savings-calculator></moneylion-savings-calculator></div><h2 data-toc-label="User Experience and Accessibility">Apple Savings User Experience and Accessibility</h2><h3>Apple Savings Mobile App Features</h3><p>The Apple Savings Account doesn&#39;t have its own&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-mobile-banking-apps">mobile banking app</a>; instead, it&#39;s accessed through your Apple Wallet. If you want your bank account to have its own dedicated app, and you don&#39;t want to go through submenus to access your account, you might want to consider another financial institution.</p><p>Usually, we include user ratings of a bank&#39;s mobile banking app to give you an idea of how easy it is to use. However, since <a href="https://businessinsider.com/apple-wallet">Apple Wallet</a> is automatically included on every iPhone, it isn&#39;t in the app store and doesn&#39;t have user ratings.</p><h3>Apple Savings Online Banking Experience</h3><p>Because all Apple Savings Account features are accessed through Apple Wallet, you can&#39;t access your savings account from the Apple website. If you don&#39;t want to do all of your online banking from your phone, you might want to consider another bank. And if you want to bank in-person, you might want to consider a bank or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-credit-unions">credit union</a> with physical branches.</p><h3>Apple Savings Customer Service and Support</h3><p>Apple offers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/banks-with-24-7-customer-support">24/7 customer service</a> through Apple Support. However, since Apple isn&#39;t a bank, there&#39;s a chance your issue will need to be shared with Apple&#39;s partner bank, Goldman Sachs. This might increase wait time if you have a problem.</p><h2>Apple Savings Security</h2><p>Apple is not a financial institution. The Apple Card and Apple Savings are issued and provided by Goldman Sachs, a Member <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/fdic">FDIC</a> bank. So even though Apple isn&#39;t a bank, deposits are insured for up to $250,000.</p><p>In addition, like many secure digital savings accounts, Apple uses end-to-end encryption to keep your financial information safe. Keep in mind, though, that it will share some of your information with Goldman Sachs in order to to provide you with banking services, including your Social Security number or individual taxpayer identification number.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Pros and Cons">Apple Savings Account Pros and Cons</h2><h3>Apple Savings Account Pros</h3><ul><li>Competitive interest rate</li><li>$0 minimum opening deposit</li></ul><h3>Apple Savings Account Cons</h3><ul><li aria-level="1">For iPhone users only</li><li aria-level="1">Must have an Apple Card</li><li>Can be complicated for new Apple users</li><li aria-level="1">May take several days to access your cash</li><li aria-level="1">No joint accounts</li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="Is It Right for You?">Is Apple Savings Right for You?</h2><p>Unless you&#39;re already an invested Apple user, you&#39;ll probably want to steer clear of an Apple Savings Account. Its good-but-not-great interest rate and lack of fees don&#39;t quite balance out its heavy opening requirements for people who aren&#39;t already using an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/best-iphone">iPhone</a> and an Apple Card. For people who are using an Apple Card, it&#39;s still important to consider that you&#39;ll have to bank exclusively through your phone and that it can take a while to withdraw your money.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How the Apple Savings Account Compares">Apple Savings Account Alternatives</h2><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"><p><strong>Featured Nationally Available High-Yield Savings Account</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/5-percent-interest-savings-accounts">Savings accounts offering at least 5%</a> are considered competitive.&nbsp;</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 245px;" border="1"><tbody><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 42.493%; height: 22px;">Account Name</td><td style="width: 32.507%; height: 22px;">APYs (Annual Percentage Yields) are accurate as of 10/16/2024</td><td style="width: 25%; height: 22px;">Minimum Account Opening Balance</td></tr><tr style="height: 47px;"><td style="width: 42.493%; height: 47px;">LendingClub LevelUp Savings Account</td><td style="width: 32.507%; height: 47px;">up to 5.30%</td><td style="width: 25%; height: 47px;">$0</td></tr><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 42.493%; height: 22px;">Western Alliance Bank High-Yield Savings Premier</td><td style="width: 32.507%; height: 22px;">4.96%</td><td style="width: 25%; height: 22px;">$500</td></tr><tr style="height: 22px;"><td style="width: 42.493%; height: 22px;">BrioDirect High-Yield Savings Account</td><td style="width: 32.507%; height: 22px;">5.05%</td><td style="width: 25%; height: 22px;">$5,000</td></tr><tr style="height: 43px;"><td style="width: 42.493%; height: 43px;">Barclays Tiered Savings</td><td style="width: 32.507%; height: 43px;">up to 4.80%</td><td style="width: 25%; height: 43px;">$0</td></tr></tbody></table></aside><h3><strong>Apple Savings Account vs. Synchrony High-Yield Savings Account</strong></h3><p>The Synchrony High Yield Savings Account&nbsp;is one of the best savings accounts right now. The bank has excellent CD rates, too.</p><p>Like Apple Savings, the Synchrony account has a $0 minimum opening deposit and no monthly service fee. However, Synchrony comes out ahead with a 4.30% APY and an ATM card &mdash; a rare feature among savings accounts. (Remember that Apple Savings users don&#39;t have immediate access to funds due to transfer delays.)</p><p>Synchrony may be the better choice if you want flexibility when accessing your cash. At the same time, Apple Savings could be a convenient way to save if you&#39;re an iPhone user with an Apple Card and are comfortable using the Apple Wallet app.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/synchrony-bank-review">Synchrony Bank Review</a></em></p><h3><strong>Apple Savings Account vs. Capital One 360 Performance Savings Account</strong></h3><p>The Capital One 360 Performance Savings account shares several features with Apple Savings. It has no monthly service fee, a $0 minimum opening deposit, and no balance requirements. They also offer similar savings rates.</p><p>What sets the two options apart is that Capital One offers other types of accounts, including a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-free-checking-accounts">free checking account</a> and CDs with competitive rates and no minimum deposit requirements.</p><p>Capital One may be more appealing if you want to open a checking account or CD at the same bank as your savings account. Meanwhile, loyal Apple users may prefer the convenience of a savings account linked to other Apple services.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/capital-one-bank-review">Capital One 360 Bank Review</a></em></p><h2 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us">Why You Should Trust Us: How We Reviewed Apple Savings</h2><p>We rated Apple Savings using Business Insider&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/methodology">bank account methodology</a>. We generally look at customer support, mobile apps, ethics, and other factors depending on the type of account we&#39;re reviewing. For example, we consider interest rates, service fees, and minimum opening deposits to review savings accounts, such as Apple Savings.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Apple Savings Account FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>What is Apple Savings?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The Apple Savings Account in an online savings account that connects to your Apple Card. It pays 4.10% APY, and it has no monthly service fee, a $0 minimum opening deposit, and no minimum balance requirements to maintain the account.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What interest rate does Apple Savings offer?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The Apple Savings Account pays 4.10% APY. This interest rate is significantly higher than the national <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/average-savings-account-interest-rate">average savings account interest rate</a>, but you can still find higher rates elsewhere.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How do I open an Apple Savings Account?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">To set up Apple Savings, open the Wallet app on your iPhone and tap Apple Card. Next, tap the three dots and select Daily Cash. Finally, tap Set Up next to Savings and follow the on-screen instructions. If your Apple Card is restricted or locked, you may be unable to open the savings account. Likewise, if your Apple Cash or Apple Savings account is restricted or locked, you may not be able to transfer money to or from Savings.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are there any fees associated with Apple Savings?</h3><p class="faq-answer">No, there aren&#39;t any Apple Savings Account fees. It doesn&#39;t require a minimum opening deposit, it doesn&#39;t charge monthly service fees, and it doesn&#39;t charge to withdraw money from your account, although the withdrawal might take a while to go through.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Is Apple Savings Secure?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Apple Savings is secure. It uses end-to-end encryption to keep your financial information safe, and it&#39;s partnered with Goldman Sachs to provide FDIC insurance for your money, protecting up to $250,000 in case Goldman Sachs fails.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/apple-savings-account-review">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you&#39;re worried about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/what-happens-if-my-bank-fails">bank failures</a>, keep in mind money is safe at a federally insured financial institution. When a financial institution is federally insured, up to $250,000 per depositor is secure in a bank account.</p><p>To help you get more familiarity with these banks, we also have provided Better Business Bureau ratings.

Paul of making false and misleading statements about party loans relating to Paul&#39;s family trusts.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Understanding 1-Year CDs and How They Work"><strong>Understanding 1-Year CDs and How They Work</strong></h2><p>A 1-year CD is a type of interest-earning bank account that you can open at a bank or credit union. CDs pay a fixed interest rate, and with a 1-year CD you&#39;ll earn the same rate for the entire year. You don&#39;t have to worry about your rate decreasing &mdash; you know how much you&#39;re going to earn. The flip side is that you won&#39;t get to benefit from a higher rate if the bank increases rates like you could with a variable-rate bank account, like a high-yield savings account or money market account. It&#39;s unlikely that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/are-cd-rates-going-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CD rates will go up in 2024</a> anyway, though.</p><p>A 1-year CD only lets you deposit money when you first open the account, and you can&#39;t make additional deposits afterwards. You also won&#39;t be able to take out money during the year because it&#39;s considered locked in. If you make a withdrawal, you&#39;ll be charged a fee called an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/cd-early-withdrawal-penalties">early withdrawal penalty</a>. The penalty is typically some of the interest you&#39;ve earned.</p><p>CDs are best for savings that you can lock in and don&#39;t need immediate access to. It can used for a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/savings-goals">savings goal</a> like a down payment on a home or an upcoming vacation.</p><p>CDs come with much lower risk than investing your money in the stock market because you have a guaranteed rate of return. If you&#39;re saving for a 1-year goal, you may want to go with the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/are-cds-safe">safer choice of opening a CD</a> instead because one year is a relatively short amount of time.</p><h2 data-toc-label="What Influences the Best 1-Year CD Rates">What Influences the Best 1-Year CD Rates</h2><p>Changes in the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/investing/what-is-the-federal-funds-rate">federal funds rate</a> impact interest rates on banking products. CD rates go up during rate hikes and drop during rate cuts.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/investing/what-is-the-federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a> is responsible for managing the federal funds rate. Eight meetings are held annually to discuss current economic conditions and potentially change rates. In the last Fed meeting, which occurred in September, the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points.&nbsp;</p><p>Market fluctuations can influence whether specific terms are more competitive than usual. Currently,<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/short-term-cd-rates"> short-term CD rates are higher long-term CD rates</a>. If you compare our top 1-year CD rates with the best 5-year terms, the former is higher.</p><p>Banks also have their own criteria for setting CD rates. You might see banks with CD specials or promotions on 1-year terms. These promotions are sometimes limited to certain customers. You also might need to deposit money from another bank (often referred to as&#34;new money&#34; by banks).</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to Find the Best 1-Year CD for You">How to Choose the Best 1-Year CD Rate</h2><p>Of course, interest rates are important when finding the best 1-year CD today. But you should also think about other criteria before getting a CD. For example, the minimum opening deposit could play an important part in choosing the right CD. If you don&#39;t have enough money to open the CD that pays the highest rate, it&#39;s still worth opening a CD that pays a little less but has a minimum you can afford.</p><p>You should also think about the early withdrawal penalty. If a bank charges high penalties for taking money out early from a 1-year CD, it could wipe out any earnings you&#39;ve accumulated. If you&#39;re worried about needing money early, you may prefer a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-no-penalty-cds">no-penalty CD</a> with a 1-year term &mdash; they aren&#39;t super common, but they do exist.</p><h3><strong>How to Open a 1-Year CD</strong></h3><p>Locking in one of the best 1-year certificates of deposits starts by looking at options at various financial institutions. Most financial institutions allow you to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/how-to-choose-a-cd">open a CD</a> online and over the phone. If the bank or credit union has physical locations, you&#39;ll also be able to open it at a branch.&nbsp;</p><p>Credit unions require membership to open <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/difference-between-share-certificate-certificate-of-deposit">share certificates.</a> You&#39;ll need to meet the membership requirements and usually open a savings account along with your CD to be considered an active member.&nbsp;</p><p>When you&#39;re applying for a CD, make sure you have documentation ready to fill out the application, like your driver&#39;s license and Social Security number. Banks have to verify your identity before you open a bank account. Some <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/banks-credit-unions-for-immigrants-non-us-citizens">banks will also let immigrants and non-U.S. Citizens use an alternative ID</a> like a foreign passport or Matricula consular.</p><p>Banks will typically require you to deposit money at account opening. Also, be aware that CDs usually only let you deposit money once unless it&#39;s an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/can-you-add-money-to-cd">add-on CD</a>. You won&#39;t be able to make additional deposits until your account reaches maturity.</p><h3>Pros and Cons of the Best 1-Year CDs</h3><p><strong>Benefits of the Best 1-Year CDs</strong></p><ul><li>Better rates than high-yield savings accounts</li><li>Guaranteed rate of return</li><li>If rates go down, you keep the higher rate you have now</li><li>Funds are insured by the FDIC</li><li>Early withdrawal penalties may help you resist spending temptation</li><li>Lower risk than the stock market</li></ul><p><strong>Disadvantages of the Best 1-Year CDs</strong></p><ul><li>If rates go up, you keep the lower rate you&#39;ve locked in</li><li>You can&#39;t add more money throughout the year</li><li>Early withdrawal penalties</li><li>Potentially lower returns than the stock market</li></ul><h3>Alternatives to a 1-Year CD</h3><p><strong>1-Year CD vs. Shorter-Term CD</strong></p><p>You might prefer a 3-month CD or 6-month CD if you can&#39;t part with your money for a full year. These are some of the best savings accounts for short-term savings because rates are high on short terms right now. For example, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-6-month-cd-rates">best 6-month CD rates</a> are comparable to the best 1-year CD rates.</p><p><strong>1-Year CD vs. Longer-Term CD</strong></p><p>You may want to put money into a longer CD term if you know you won&#39;t need it for more than a year. Plenty of online institutions are paying great rates on terms up to five years. However, the best 1-year CD rates are higher than long-term CDs, including the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-5-year-cd-rates">best 5-year CD rates</a>.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to open multiple CD terms at once, you could use a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/cd-ladder">CD ladder</a>, which involves splitting your money into multiple CD terms so you can access it at different times. For example, you could open a 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year CD. This helps you avoid some risk. You&#39;d have access to your money and earned interest after one, three, and five years, which may be helpful if you need to make an early withdrawal. This CD strategy can also help you lock in high rates now before rates drop further.</p><p><strong>1-Year CD vs. High-Yield Savings Account</strong></p><p>One-year CDs are paying even better rates than the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-high-yield-savings-accounts-rates-right-now">best high-yield savings accounts</a>. But you still might prefer the latter for two reasons: You can deposit money at any time, and you can withdraw money without paying a penalty.</p><p>&nbsp;When trying to decide between<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/cds-vs-high-yield-savings"> CDs versus high-yield savings accounts</a>, remember that both are great savings tools, so there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t open both accounts to save for different goals.</p><p><strong>1-Year CD vs. Money Market Account</strong></p><p>A money market account is similar to a savings account, except it usually comes with some perks you&#39;d get with a checking account, such as an ATM card, debit card, or paper checks. Basically, it makes it easier to access your money. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-money-market-accounts">best money market accounts</a> pay great rates, but they&#39;re still not as high as the best 1-year CD rates. A money market account could be a good fit if you want easier access to your savings, though, especially since CDs don&#39;t allow you to withdraw funds without paying a penalty.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">1-Year CD FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Who has the highest 1-year CD rate today?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The highest 1-year CD rate today is from EFCU Financial, which offers a 1-year CD with 4.90% APY.</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;list&#34;,{},&#34;list_item&#34;,{&#34;indent&#34;:1,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;bulleted&#34;}]"><strong>What are the best 1-year CD rates for 2024?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The best 1-year CD rates today range from 4.50% APY to 4.90% APY.</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;list&#34;,{},&#34;list_item&#34;,{&#34;indent&#34;:1,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;bulleted&#34;}]"><strong>Why are 1-year CDs a popular choice?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">A 1-year CD is a popular choice because it pays a fixed <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/what-is-interest">interest rate</a> for one year.

For credit unions, the equivalent is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/how-ncua-insurance-works-credit-union">NCUA insurance</a>. Next, she says, consider the experience you want to have with your bank: Do you want to walk in and talk to a person? Then you need a bank with a local branch. Are you fine never speaking to someone in person? Then an online bank will work for you. Do you write checks (or not)? Then you need an account that comes with checks.</p><p>Sophia Acevedo, banking editor for Business Insider, adds that it&#39;s a good idea to include costs in your list of priorities. For instance, is there a monthly fee for the account you want? If so, what are the requirements to waive it &mdash; and can you meet them? If it&#39;s important that you earn interest, you&#39;ll want to choose a bank and an account that pays a higher interest rate than the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/average-bank-interest-rates" rel="" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="540f68b866d4d1e9c30aa915b76a1150">average bank account</a>.</p><p><strong>How do you choose between all the available CD terms?</strong></p><p>Roger Ma, CFPÂ® professional and author of <span>&#34;Work Your Money, Not Your Life&#34;</span>, says you should start by deciding when you need the money, then looking at available rates for CDs with similar timing.</p><p>Knowing how you&#39;ll use the money you plan to put in a CD is central to the one you choose, says Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor at <a href="https://www.boujiebudgets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="2cf30a6077693f0e2adb1334f9258693" data-analytics-module="body_link">BoujieBudgets.com</a>. Perhaps it&#39;s a house fund &mdash; in that case, if you know that you want to buy a house in two years, you&#39;ll need to make sure your CD term ends by then.</p><p><strong>When do you use a CD instead of a high-yield savings account or money market account?</strong></p><p>Brown says you should know two things to help make this decision: how much money you&#39;ll be putting in, and how much you plan to interact with that money. If you&#39;re going to need to make transactions before the term of a CD ends, you&#39;ll have to choose a high-yield savings or money market account.</p><p>Acevedo adds that both the high-yield savings account and money market account can be good options for an emergency fund or short-term savings goals. The best savings accounts tend to offer strong interest rates, while money market accounts typically offer more access to your money, like paper checks or debit cards.</p><p><strong>Our Methodology: How We Chose the Best 1-Year CDs</strong></p><p>Business Insider&#39;s personal finance team regularly monitors 1-year CD rates at over 60 banks, credit unions, and banking platforms.

The details for these products have not been reviewed or provided by the issuer.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/chase-bank-review">Chase Bank</a> is one of the largest U.S. banks with a wide range of financial services and products, it does not offer personal loans. If you&#39;re looking for a personal loan, you&#39;ll need to skip Chase and apply for one of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/best-personal-loans">best personal loans</a> available with another bank, credit union, or online lender.</p><p>We&#39;ve rounded up some alternatives to Chase that you should consider if you&#39;re searching for a personal loan as well as other financing options you can try instead if you&#39;re a Chase loyalist.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Why Chase Doesn&#39;t Offer Personal Loans">Why Chase Doesn&#39;t Offer Personal Loans</h2><h3>Chase&#39;s Focus on Other Financial Products</h3><p>Chase doesn&#39;t provide unsecured personal loans, though it does offer a range of other loan products, including <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/chase-mortgage-review">Chase mortgages</a> and auto loans. The bank&#39;s main draw for those looking for financing is, instead, its various well-liked credit card products. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-chase-card">Chase credit cards</a> run the gamut, offering perks like long 0% interest introductory periods, sign-up bonuses, cash back, and travel benefits.</p><h3>Chase&#39;s Personal Lending Alternatives</h3><p><strong>My Chase Loan</strong></p><p>While Chase doesn&#39;t offer traditional personal loans, it does allow its credit card customers to borrow a lump sum of cash against their existing credit limit. The funds are deposited directly into your bank account and come with a fixed, lower APR than your card&#39;s standard purchase APR, or what you&#39;d normally pay for carrying a balance on your credit card.&nbsp;</p><p>Because the My Chase Loan is obtained through your existing credit card account, you do not need to submit a new application, meaning there is no credit check, application fee, or origination fee. Chase also charges no fees for paying off this type of loan early. You must borrow at least $500 and the bank caps your loan size maximum at a portion of your available credit limit.</p><p><strong>0% Intro APR Credit Cards</strong></p><p>Chase has several different credit card options open to new customers that can help you finance a purchase, similarly to how a personal loan can. Because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates, or APRs, than personal loans, opting for a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-zero-interest-credit-cards">card with a long introductory 0% interest rate</a> can be a smart money-saving way to afford financing.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-slate-edge-card-review">Chase Slate Edgeâ </a> currently gives new users 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 18 months from account opening (then 20.49% - 29.24% Variable).</li><li>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-freedom-flex-credit-card-review">Chase Freedom FlexÂ®</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-freedom-flex-credit-card-review">Chase Freedom FlexÂ®</a> offer 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months (then19.99% - 28.74% Variable).</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that if you do not pay off your balance in full before the promotional period ends, you will be charged the card&#39;s standard APR &mdash; regardless of when you incurred the debt.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Best Alternatives to a Chase Personal Loan">Best Alternatives to a Chase Personal Loan</h2><h3>1. Banks That Offer Personal Loans</h3><p>Although Chase doesn&#39;t offer unsecured personal loans, many other large brick-and-mortar U.S. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-banks">banks</a> do. If you&#39;re looking for a personal loan and prefer to work with a traditional bank, consider these:</p><p><strong>U.S. Bank Personal Loans</strong></p><p>A US Bank personal loan could be a good choice if you&#39;re an existing customer and want to take out a personal loan from the same institution where you already do your banking.&nbsp;</p><p>The bank offers perks to its existing customers, including funding time as short as a few hours and a higher maximum loan amount. You can borrow as little as $1,000 from US Bank, and the bank offers competitive <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/average-personal-loan-interest-rates">personal loan interest rates</a> ranging from 8.74% to 24.99%.

But if you aren&#39;t a current customer, you&#39;ll need to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/how-to-get-a-personal-loan">apply for a personal loan</a> in person at a branch.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of the more common autopay discounts offered by lenders to anyone who sets up automatic payments on their loans, Wells Fargo offers discounts to current customers who pay their loans through their consumer accounts.</p><p>Read our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/wells-fargo-personal-loan-review">Wells Fargo personal loan review</a>.</p><h3>2. Online Lenders and Peer-to-Peer Lending Platforms</h3><p>Online personal loans offer interest rates, terms, and other features that are competitive with those you can get on loans from a bank or credit union. However, the process of getting one is completely online. Therefore, you won&#39;t be able to get the kind of in-person assistance you would find at brick-and-mortar lenders.&nbsp;</p><p>You could also try peer-to-peer lending platforms, which connect people or businesses willing to finance loans with those in need of loans.</p><p>These are some of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/best-online-loans">best online loans</a> and peer-to-peer lending options to consider if you&#39;re looking for an alternative to a Chase personal loan:</p><p><strong>LightStream Personal Loan</strong></p><p>LightStream offers some of the lowest rates on personal loans available to borrowers with excellent credit scores.

Avant offers some of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/best-personal-loans-bad-credit">best personal loans for bad credit</a>. But remember, the lower your credit score, the more you&#39;ll pay in interest. Avant&#39;s APRs range from 9.95% to 35.99%. You can borrow from $2,000 to $35,000 with an Avant personal loan.</p><p>Read our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/avant-personal-loan-review">Avant personal loan review</a>.</p><p><strong>Upstart Personal Loan</strong></p><p>Upstart is a peer-to-peer lending platform that connects borrowers with multiple lending partners at once.

Credit Unions Offering Competitive Personal Loans</h3><p>Borrowing from a credit union instead of a bank offers some advantages. The National Credit Union Administration caps interest rates at 18%. If you don&#39;t have a great credit score, you could get a lower interest rate from a credit union than a bank. You&#39;re also more likely to find smaller minimum loan amounts at credit unions.</p><p>These are some of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/best-credit-unions-personal-loans">best credit unions for personal loans</a>:</p><p><strong>Service Credit Union Personal Loan</strong></p><p>Service Credit Union personal loans may be approved within 24 hours of receiving your application, so it could be a good choice if you need a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/best-quick-personal-loans-fast-cash">quick personal loan for fast cash</a>.

Of the 28 loan providers Business Insider tracks, the lowest rate available as of publishing time was 5.91% but the highest was 99.99%.&nbsp;</p><p>The rate and term you&#39;re offered will likely depend on your credit score, the lender you work with, and the amount you borrow. Currently, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/average-personal-loan-interest-rates">average personal loan interest rate</a> is 21.17%, but those with excellent credit can get much lower rates, around 11.6%. Those with poor credit will face steeper rates of around 30.7%.</p><p>Most personal loans must be repaid within one to seven years, but some lenders may offer longer loan terms. Generally, the longer the term length, the lower your monthly payments but the more you&#39;ll pay in interest costs. Choosing the shortest loan term with monthly payments you can afford can help you keep borrowing costs down.</p><h3>Credit Score Requirements and Eligibility</h3><p>To get a personal loan, you must typically be 18 years of age or older, have a valid form of U.S. identification, have a bank or credit union account, and be able to provide documents verifying your income.</p><p>Each lender makes its own determination on what credit scores it will accept. But, typically, those with a FICO score of 670 or higher will qualify for many lenders&#39; personal loans and receive competitive interest rates and terms. Having an even higher credit score means you&#39;ll get the lowest rates.&nbsp;</p><p>Those with fair or poor credit aren&#39;t out of luck. Some lenders cater specifically to those with low scores but charge higher interest rates and fees in return for providing funding.</p><h3>Fees and Additional Costs</h3><p>Lenders may charge a fee for issuing you a personal loan. This one-time upfront cost, known as an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/what-is-an-origination-fee">origination fee</a>, application fee, or processing fee, is usually a percentage of your original loan amount. The fee typically ranges from 0.5% to 8% of the amount you borrow, although some lenders may charge even more. This extra charge can be paid out of the loan funds you receive or tacked onto the loan&#39;s balance.</p><p>Some personal loans also charge late fees if you miss a payment deadline or fail to make a repayment in full. These fees can be a fixed amount, commonly $25 to $50, or a small percentage of the monthly payment amount, often 3% to 5%.</p><p>Paying off the loan in full early can also trigger a fee. Some lenders charge prepayment penalties if you do this as they lose out on a portion of the interest income you&#39;d have paid them according to the original schedule. These fees usually equal 1%-2% of whatever the remaining balance would have been.</p><h3>Funding Time</h3><p>Many lenders offer quick turnarounds when it comes to approving loan applications and depositing loan funds, but some can take a few days or longer. If you need the money fast, it is worth looking into how long each lender&#39;s loan approval process takes and how quickly you can access your money once the loan is approved. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/best-online-loans">Online lenders</a> tend to be the speediest, with some depositing loan proceeds the same day the loan is approved. Banks and credit unions usually take a little longer.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Alternative Chase Financial Products to Consider">Alternative Chase Financial Products to Consider</h2><h3>Chase Credit Cards with Introductory 0% APR</h3><p>Several Chase credit cards come with a 0% introductory interest rate, meaning you won&#39;t pay any financing costs on new purchases or balance transfers during this time. Once the promotional offer ends, you&#39;ll pay the standard APR.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the following Chase cards offer this perk:</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-slate-edge-card-review">Chase Slate Edgeâ </a>:&nbsp;</strong>0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 18 months from account opening, then 20.49% - 29.24% Variable&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1"><strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-freedom-unlimited-review">Chase Freedom UnlimitedÂ®</a>:&nbsp;</strong>0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months, then</li><li aria-level="1"><strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-freedom-flex-credit-card-review">Chase Freedom FlexÂ®</a>:&nbsp;</strong>0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months, then 19.99% - 28.74% Variable</li></ul><p>There are also two Chase business credit cards offering an intro APR period of 0%:</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-ink-business-unlimited-credit-card-review">Ink Business UnlimitedÂ® Credit Card</a>:</strong> 0% intro APR on purchases for the first 12 months, then 17.99% - 23.99% Variable</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-ink-business-cash-credit-card-review">Ink Business CashÂ® Credit Card</a>:&nbsp;</strong>0% intro APR on purchases for the first 12 months, then 17.99% - 23.99% Variable</li></ul><h3>Chase Auto Loans&nbsp;</h3><p>Chase provides auto loans to help finance the purchase of a new or used car. By disclosing your personal details, new car details, and the dealer you&#39;re buying from, Chase will let you know if you qualify for a loan, and, if so, the applicable rates and terms. Your loan offer stands for 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p>The bank does not accept co-signers and limits car buyers to purchasing from its 10,000-plus network of dealerships. Rates vary depending on your credit score, financial background, and the car you buy, but Chase does not publicly disclose a range. Loans can last between 12 and 84 months and do not charge an origination fee.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Pros and Cons of Personal Loans vs. Other Financing Options">Pros and Cons of Personal Loans vs. Other Financing Options</h2><h3>Advantages of Personal Loans</h3><p><strong>Flexibility.</strong> Because the loan funds are deposited in cash into your bank account, you control how they&#39;re used and how quickly the money is spent. Personal loans can be used for a variety of purposes from consolidating debt to making home repairs to paying for a large purchase.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Large loan amounts</strong>. Many lenders offer sizable personal loan maximums, with many willing to extend as much as $100,000 to borrowers.</p><p><strong>Lower interest rates.</strong> Personal loans typically charge less interest than credit cards do. Those with excellent credit can get APRs as low as 6% or 7% on a personal loan. Many issuers have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/average-credit-card-interest-rate">credit card interest rates averaging</a> around 20%. Personal loans also have fixed rates and repayment terms, meaning your monthly repayment won&#39;t fluctuate as they do with a credit card.</p><h3>Disadvantages of Personal Loans Compared to HELOCs and Credit Cards</h3><p><strong>Fees</strong>. Personal loans can charge origination fees and prepayment penalties, which can greatly add to your financing costs. Some <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/heloc-pros-and-cons">home equity lines of credit</a> (HELOCs) may also charge these costs, but credit cards don&#39;t charge either.</p><p><strong>Need a good credit score. </strong>While some lenders do offer loans to those with poor credit scores, most prefer applicants with FICO scores of 670 or better. A high credit score also means you&#39;ll get the lowest interest rates and best terms. If your score is low, you may face extremely high interest rates that make repaying the loan unmanageable. HELOCs usually require a high credit score as well, but you may face better approval odds if your home has a large amount of equity since the lender can claim the property as collateral if you fail to repay the debt. The credit cards with the best perks typically go to those with high credit scores, but card companies tend to be less fussy than loan providers when it comes to approving new applicants.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Frequently Asked Questions on Chase Personal Loans</h2><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Does Chase offer personal loans?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">No, you cannot get an unsecured personal loan from Chase. However, the bank does offer secured loans, such as auto loans and mortgages, which are backed by collateral.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>What are the best alternatives to a Chase personal loan?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans with competitive rates and repayment terms offer strong alternatives to a Chase personal loan. These include LightStream, Wells Fargo, SoFi, and Avant. Existing Chase credit card customers should also consider a My Chase Loan available through their existing credit limit.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Can I use a HELOC or a credit card instead of a personal loan?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, tapping your home equity through a HELOC or using your credit card&#39;s existing credit line are both alternative ways to finance a purchase without needing a personal loan.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Which banks offer personal loans?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Banks such as Wells Fargo, Citibank, U.S. Bank, PNC Bank, and TD Bank offer personal loans</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>What is peer-to-peer lending, and is it a good alternative?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Peer-to-peer lending platforms connect individuals or businesses looking to finance loans directly with people needing to borrow money, bypassing traditional lenders, such as banks or credit unions. It can be a useful option for those with poor credit scores, who need a co-borrower or co-signer, or who want to try for a lower interest rate than traditional lenders will give them.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/chase-personal-loans">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

Many require a deposit of at least $500 or $1,000.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Should I lock in a longer-term CD for a 5% rate, or wait?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in four years in September. At the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/when-is-the-next-fed-meeting">next Fed meeting</a>, it&#39;s likely that another rate cut may occur. It may be a good time to lock in a relatively high interest rate with a CD before rates decline and these competitive rates are gone.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Is it better to invest in a 5% CD or a high-yield savings account?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">You&#39;ll earn more interest over time in a CD than in a high-yield savings account, but you won&#39;t be able to access your money without paying a penalty. Use a high-yield savings account if you need easy access to your funds.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/5-percent-certificate-of-deposit-cd">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li>A credit line is a flexible funding option offered at financial institutions for revolving access to cash.</li>
<li>Your credit score will determine eligibility and how much credit you qualify for.</li>
<li>HELOCs are the most common type of credit line, but there are also personal or business lines of credit.</li>
</ul><p>When you&#39;re borrowing money, it&#39;s good to shop around for the best option. For large purchases, you may look for a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/best-personal-loans">personal loan</a>. For smaller, everyday purchases, you might want more flexibility in how you spend and pay them off. For that, looking into a line of credit might be worth your time.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="What is a line of credit?">What is a line of credit?</h2><p>A line of credit, also known as a credit line, is a type of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/what-is-revolving-credit">revolving credit</a>. It&#39;s an amount of money extended to you by a financial institution, such as a bank, that you can draw from when needed.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;table&#34;,{},&#34;table_row&#34;,{},&#34;table_cell&#34;,{&#34;colspan&#34;:1,&#34;rowspan&#34;:1,&#34;colwidth&#34;:[120]}]">The difference between a line of credit and a loan</h3><p>A credit line differs from a loan because you can draw upon any amount up to a certain limit at any time instead of receiving a lump sum that you gradually pay off as you would with a loan. So, if you have a $10,000 credit line, you can draw upon $5,000 for a new home repair project when you need it while still having $5,000 left on your line of credit. If you pay off the borrowed money, your limit will go back to $10,000.</p><h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;table&#34;,{},&#34;table_row&#34;,{},&#34;table_cell&#34;,{&#34;colspan&#34;:1,&#34;rowspan&#34;:1,&#34;colwidth&#34;:[120]}]">Key characteristics of a line of credit</h3><p>There are several ways you can access your line of credit funds. Some lenders will give their borrowers special checks that draw from their line of credit once cashed. Some lines of credit will require borrowers to manually transfer money from their line of credit into their bank accounts. Others simply give you a card to use, like a credit card. Once you draw from the funds available, you&#39;ll start accruing interest on the borrowed amount.</p><p>As you pay back what you borrowed, your available credit will increase. A line of credit can offer more flexibility in the amount you borrow and what you have access to compared to a traditional <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/what-is-an-installment-loan">installment loan</a>.</p><h3>Line of credit vs. credit card</h3><p>All credit cards are lines of credit; however, not all lines of credit are credit cards.&nbsp;</p><p>Lines of credit and credit cards differ in how much you&#39;ll be paying and how much you&#39;ll be getting in return. Credit cards generally have higher&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/what-is-apr">APRs</a> than other lines of credit, which means you&#39;ll be paying more to use a credit card than a line of credit. However, you can earn points or other perks when using a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-rewards-credit-cards">rewards credit card</a>.</p><p>Lines of credit also tend to have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/how-to-increase-credit-limit">higher credit limits</a> than credit cards, so you can use more before worrying about how it will affect your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/credit-utilization-ratio">credit utilization ratio</a>.</p><p>Another key difference between the two comes down to flexibility. While lines of credit offer more freedom than a personal loan, they&#39;re still more rigid than credit cards. This is because lines of credit have a time limit to borrow money, known as a draw period. These will differ based on the type of credit line you choose, but you&#39;ll have a few years to borrow money. You&#39;ll still have to make minimum payments during your draw period, but these will be small, usually just enough to cover any interest accrued.</p><p>Once the draw period ends, the credit line will enter a repayment period. In this period, your remaining balance on the line of credit turns into an amortized loan that you&#39;ll start paying off. You will also no longer be able to borrow additional money through that credit line.</p><h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;table&#34;,{},&#34;table_row&#34;,{},&#34;table_cell&#34;,{&#34;colspan&#34;:1,&#34;rowspan&#34;:1,&#34;colwidth&#34;:[120]}]" data-toc-label="Types of lines of credit">Types of lines of credit</h2><p>There are various types of credit lines that you may be eligible for, including <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/what-is-an-unsecured-loan">secured and unsecured credit lines</a>. Secured credit lines are backed by an asset, such as a car or home, which serves as collateral. Some banks that offer brokerage services may also allow you to use your investments as collateral. On the other hand, unsecured credit lines aren&#39;t backed by any collateral, e.g., most credit cards.</p><h3>Home equity line of credit (HELOC)</h3><p>One popular line of credit is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/current-heloc-rates">home equity line of credit</a>, more commonly known as a HELOC. Using a HELOC, homeowners can borrow funds against the equity from the home, meaning the amount of the home&#39;s value that you own. If you&#39;re still paying a mortgage, you can borrow against what you&#39;ve already paid off.</p><p>HELOCs usually have a draw period of 10 years, at which point you enter the repayment period; some HELOCs require you to settle your debts at the end of the draw period. Some HELOCs will require you to take out a minimum amount upfront.</p><p>Because your home value secures your line of credit, you won&#39;t need as high of a credit score to qualify. You&#39;ll usually be able to borrow up to 85% of your home&#39;s equity.</p><h3>Personal line of credit</h3><p>Other types of unsecured lines of credit, such as personal lines of credit, don&#39;t have any assets to serve as collateral but may have fees, though there may be an annual fee or upfront costs to access the line of credit. You might want to use one to pay for school expenses or car maintenance costs or fund a business-related project &mdash; so long as you know you can repay the loan.</p><p>Draw periods on personal lines of credit are typically shorter than those on HELOCs.</p><h3>Business line of credit</h3><p>Like other lines of credit, a business line of credit offers greater flexibility than its loan counterpart. A small business loan will give a business owner a lump sum of money they&#39;ll have to pay off gradually. Meanwhile, a business line of credit will allow business owners to pay for expenses as they arise. Keep in mind that a business line of credit will also be more expensive than a business loan.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;table&#34;,{},&#34;table_row&#34;,{},&#34;table_cell&#34;,{&#34;colspan&#34;:1,&#34;rowspan&#34;:1,&#34;colwidth&#34;:[120]}]" data-toc-label="Benefits and risks of using a line of credit">Benefits and risks of using a line of credit</h2><h3>Benefits of using a line of credit</h3><ul><li aria-level="1">Interest payments: Unlike a traditional loan, you only pay interest on the money you use rather than on the entire loan amount.</li><li aria-level="1">Flexibility: A personal line of credit usually has a long time period in which you can use it, often a few years.

You go to your bank of choice and apply for one. However, there are several things you should consider during the process.</p><h3>1. Credit score and income requirements</h3><p>Each lender will have their own credit and income requirements for approving you for a line of credit. Before applying for a credit line with a bank, you want to know where you stand, credit-wise. You can <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/how-to-read-a-credit-report-check-score">check your credit report</a> at <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. The information in your credit report is used to calculate your credit score, so you want to make sure everything looks correct. If there are errors, you can <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/how-to-dispute-credit-report-improve-credit">file a dispute</a> to fix them.</p><p>You can also sign up for a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/best-credit-monitoring-services">credit monitoring service</a>, which will give you access to your credit score and keep you updated on any changes to your report.</p><h3>2. Shop around&nbsp;</h3><p>Once you know your credit score, you can apply for a line of credit at a financial institution, such as a bank or credit union. Shop around for the best rates and check out any limits and eligibility requirements, specifically regarding your credit score. You typically want at least a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/what-is-a-good-credit-score">good credit score</a>&nbsp;(670 or higher) when applying for an unsecured personal line of credit or a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/heloc-pros-and-cons">HELOC</a>. You can get a line of credit for several thousand dollars up to $50,000 if your credit score qualifies you for it.</p><p>When comparing credit lines, you will want to focus on the terms of agreement each financial institution offers. Compare credit limits, annual fees, and APRs.&nbsp;</p><p>You will also want to look at how long your draw period is and how you will be expected to pay after it ends. Some plans ask that you pay it all back at the end of the draw period, also called a balloon payment, which changes how you borrow. Some plans will also require that you borrow a certain amount from your credit line upfront.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Apply for a credit line</h3><p>Once you&#39;ve made a decision, you&#39;ll have to submit a credit application.</p><p>When reviewing your application, a lender will pull a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/what-is-hard-credit-inquiry">hard inquiry</a> on your credit, giving them access to your credit history. This will show up on your credit report and will lower your score temporarily. Once approved, the financial institution will approve you for a specific amount and have a draw period in which you can use money from your credit line. The draw period can vary but may last up to several years.</p><p>Interest will start to accrue after borrowing from the credit line and you&#39;ll begin to make payments. As you pay back the credit line, your available credit from your credit line will increase.</p><h3>4. Use your line of credit</h3><p>Once you have your line of credit, you can start borrowing according to the rules established by your lender. Depending on your credit line, you may have to take out a minimum payment upfront.</p><p>Remember the terms you agreed to when you signed off on your credit line. Most lenders don&#39;t have restrictions on what you spend your money on. Regardless, you shouldn&#39;t spend too freely, especially if a balloon payment is waiting for you at the end of your draw period.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQ">Frequently asked questions about a line of credit</h2><h3 class="faq-question">How high can my line of credit be?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Limits on personal lines of credit can usually be as high as $50,000. Your credit limit on a HELOC will depend on the value of your house.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How does a line of credit affect your credit score?</h3><p class="faq-answer">A line of credit can affect your credit score just like any other credit product. Applying for a line of credit will result in a hard inquiry on your credit report, the new credit will impact your utilization, and how diligently you pay your bill will impact your payment history.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Can you qualify for a line of credit with bad credit?</h3><p class="faq-answer">You can qualify for a line of credit with bad credit, but it&#39;s harder. If you have a bad credit score, below 670, you may encounter difficulties when applying for a line of credit. Lending standards for HELOCs are slightly looser, especially for homeowners with valuable homes.&nbsp;</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/what-is-line-of-credit">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/loan-depot-mortgage-review</link>
      <description>See LoanDepot&#39;s mortgage offerings in 2024. Our review looks at loan options, application process, rates, and customer service. Decide if this lender is right for you.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="financial-disclaimer">The offers and details on this page may have updated or changed since the time of publication. See our article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/loan-depot-mortgage-review" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> for current information.</p><p class="headline-regular financial-disclaimer">Affiliate links for the products on this page are from partners that compensate us (see our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/our-partners" class="not-content-link" target="_blank">advertiser disclosure with our list of partners</a> for more details). However, our opinions are our own. See <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/how-we-evaluate-mortgage-lenders" class="not-content-link" target="_blank">how we rate mortgages</a> to write unbiased product reviews.</p><p>Business Insider&#39;s personal finance team compared LoanDepot to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/best-mortgage-lenders">best mortgage lenders</a> and found its offerings to be fairly standard. LoanDepot (often stylized as &#34;loanDepot&#34;) is one of the largest mortgage lenders in the country. It has a lot of positive customer reviews and low average rates. But its mortgage options are pretty basic.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Overview">Overview of LoanDepot as a Top Mortgage Lender</h2><p>LoanDepot lends mortgages in all 50 states. It&#39;s primarily known as an online lender, but it also has over 200 physical branch locations throughout the U.S.</p><p>In 2023, LoanDepot was the tenth-largest mortgage lender in the country by number of loans originated, according to a <a href="https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/list/50-top-mortgage-originators-in-2023-hmda-data">National Mortgage News</a> analysis of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Mortgage Products">LoanDepot&#39;s Mortgage Products</h2><h3>Conventional Loans</h3><p>You can get a conventional <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/conforming-loans">conforming loan</a> from LoanDepot, but you&#39;ll need a down payment of at least 5%. Many lenders allow 3% down payments on these mortgages. The minimum credit score is 620.</p><p>LoanDepot has both fixed and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/adjustable-rate-mortgage">adjustable-rate</a> conventional loans.</p><h3>Jumbo Loans</h3><p>With a LoanDepot <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/what-is-a-jumbo-loan">jumbo loan</a>, you could borrow up to $3 million. You may need a credit score of at least 700 to qualify.</p><h3>FHA and VA Loans</h3><p>LoanDepot offers two types of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/government-home-loans">government-backed loans</a>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/fha-loan">FHA loans</a></li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/va-loans">VA loans</a></li></ul><p>To get an FHA loan with this lender, you&#39;ll need a down payment of 3.5% and a minimum credit score of 580. If you have a lower score, you may still qualify with a 10% down payment. The lender doesn&#39;t disclose its credit requirements for VA loans on its website. VA loans allow no down payment.</p><h3>Renovation Loans</h3><p>LoanDepot also has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/203k-loan">FHA 203(k) loans</a>, which are a type of renovation mortgage. You&#39;ll need a score of at least 620 to qualify.</p><h3>HELOCs</h3><p>If you want to tap into your home&#39;s equity, you could get a home equity line or credit, or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/heloc-pros-and-cons">HELOC</a>, from LoanDepot.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Rates and Fees">LoanDepot Interest Rates and Fees</h2><h3>How LoanDepot&#39;s Rates Compare to Industry Standards</h3><p>Based on Business Insider&#39;s review of <a href="https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-browser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-mrf-link="https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-browser/">Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data</a>, LoanDepot&#39;s interest rates are a bit lower than average.</p><p>But unlike some mortgage lenders, LoanDepot doesn&#39;t provide sample rates online or offer a customized rate tool to see what rate you might get based on your finances and credit score. You&#39;ll need to talk to a loan officer or get preapproved to get a personalized rate quote.&nbsp;</p><h3>Potential Fees and Closing Costs</h3><p>According to the latest HMDA data, borrowers who got a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/conventional-mortgage">conventional mortgage</a> from LoanDepot in 2023 paid an average of $4,572 in origination charges. This is around average compared to other lenders.</p><p>When you get a mortgage, you&#39;ll pay fees to the lender as well as third-party fees as part of your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/what-are-mortgage-closing-costs">closing costs</a>. Fees paid to the lender include things like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/what-is-an-origination-fee">origination fees</a> and mortgage points. Third-party fees include costs for services charged by other entities, like title insurance. The loan estimate you receive when you apply for a mortgage can give you more information on what fees you&#39;ll incur and how much they could cost.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Overall Rating">LoanDepot Overall Rating</h2><h3><strong>Loan Types: 3.5 out of 5</strong></h3><p>Most borrowers will probably find the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/types-of-mortgage-loans">type of mortgage</a> they&#39;re looking for with this lender, since it offers all of the most common loan types. It also offers renovation loans and HELOCs. But if you&#39;re looking for something less common, you&#39;ll need to apply elsewhere.</p><h3><strong>Affordability: 3.5 out of 5</strong></h3><p>LoanDepot requires a 5% <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/how-much-down-payment-for-a-house">down payment for a house</a> on its conforming loans, which is slightly higher than the 3% that many other lenders allow. This requirement could make this lender a little less affordable for first-time homebuyers. It does offer FHA loans, which are often touted for their affordability, to borrowers with scores down to 580 with a 3.5% down payment. You may be able to get an FHA loan from this lender with a score as low as 500 if you can put at least 10% down. Its average mortgage rates are also on the low end.</p><h3><strong>Customer Satisfaction: 3.24 out of 5</strong></h3><p>On its <a href="https://www.zillow.com/lender-profile/loanDepot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zillow lender profile</a>, LoanDepot has a 4.92 out of 5 stars, based on more than 8,000 online customer reviews. On <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/loandepot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrustPilot</a>, it has a 3.8 out of 5-star rating, based on over 4,000 customer reviews. But in <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2023-us-mortgage-origination-satisfaction-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J.D. Power&#39;s 2023 U.S. Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study</a>, LoanDepot ranked well below the industry average.</p><h3><strong>Trustworthiness: 4 out of 5</strong></h3><p>LoanDepot has received an <a href="https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/foothill-ranch/profile/loans/loandepot-1126-100089796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A+ rating</a> from the Better Business Bureau. The BBB rates businesses according to how they deal with customer issues and their overall transparency and honesty.</p><p>However, it has been the subject of a couple of lawsuits in the past, and earlier this year it was the victim of a cyberattack in which almost 17 million customers had their personal information stolen.</p><p>In January 2024, LoanDepot announced that it had experienced a &#34;<a href="https://loandepot.cyberincidentupdate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyber incident</a>.&#34; In an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001831631/000183163124000004/ldi-20240104.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC filing</a>, the company said it recently detected &#34;unauthorized third party activity,&#34; which &#34;included access to certain Company systems and the encryption of data.&#34; In February, the company disclosed that nearly 17 million customers&#39; data was stolen, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/loandepot-millions-sensitive-personal-data-ransomware/">TechCrunch reported</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2023, <a href="https://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/loandepot-settles-class-action-lawsuit-35m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoanDepot settled a class-action lawsuit</a> brought by shareholders who claimed the lender made misleading disclosures around the time of its initial public offering in 2021. LoanDepot denies any wrongdoing.</p><p>Additionally, a 2021 lawsuit from the company&#39;s former COO alleges that LoanDepot, under the direction of then-CEO Anthony Hsieh, approved loans without proper documentation. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/business/loandepot-lawsuit-Anthony-Hsieh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, LoanDepot said that a third-party investigation had found the claims to be &#34;without merit.&#34; Hsieh is no longer CEO.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Pros and Cons">LoanDepot Pros and Cons</h2><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li>Average rates are relatively low</li><li>More than 200 physical branch locations, plus you can apply online from anywhere in the U.S.</li><li>Offers renovation loans</li><li>Current LoanDepot borrowers can refinance with no lender fees</li></ul><p>LoanDepot might be a good choice if you&#39;re looking for an in-person lending experience. It has more than 200 physical branch locations, meaning you can apply for a mortgage at a local LoanDepot branch if you prefer that over applying online.</p><p>We also like that this lender offers a lower-cost option for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/when-to-refinance-mortgage">refinancing your home</a>: If you got your original mortgage with LoanDepot, you can refinance here without paying lender fees.</p><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li>No general or personalized mortgage rates listed on the website</li><li>Limited loan options</li><li>Requires a 5% down payment on conforming loans, while some lenders only require 3%</li></ul><p>Something we aren&#39;t crazy about &ndash; but isn&#39;t a dealbreaker &ndash; is that LoanDepot doesn&#39;t provide any information about its rates online or let you explore personalized rates without applying for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/mortgage-preapproval">mortgage preapproval</a>. Many lenders make it easy to see an estimate of what you might pay to get a loan with them, but LoanDepot doesn&#39;t provide any such clues. However, based on our review of the latest federal data, it looks like LoanDepot customers generally are able to snag slightly lower-than-average rates.</p><p>Another reason you might not choose this lender is that it requires a minimum of 5% down on its conforming mortgages. Many other lenders allow down payments of just 3% on these mortgages. While this might not sound like a huge deal, there&#39;s a $4,000 difference between putting 3% versus 5% down on a $200,000 home.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to Apply">LoanDepot Application Process</h2><p>You can get started with LoanDepot online, over the phone, or at one of its branches. You can search for a branch near you on its website.</p><p>When you start a mortgage application, you&#39;ll need to provide some basic information about yourself and the home you want to finance. If you haven&#39;t found a home yet, you&#39;ll provide an estimate of your homebuying budget and how much you intend to put down.</p><p>Then, the lender will work to verify your information and get you an estimate of what you likely qualify for. It may ask for certain documentation and permission to pull your credit.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/documents-needed-for-mortgage-application">documents needed for a mortgage application</a> include things that show your income and assets, including W-2s, paystubs, tax returns, and bank statements. Having this ready ahead of time can help the process go faster.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you find a home, the lender will need to know the address so it can schedule a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/what-is-home-appraisal">home appraisal</a>. This is to make sure the lender isn&#39;t lending more than what the home is actually worth.&nbsp;</p><p>Your loan officer will guide you through the application process and answer any questions you have.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Customer Service and Feedback">LoanDepot Customer Service and Feedback</h2><p>Business Insider looked at positive and negative customer reviews, online forums, BBB complaints, and other sources to understand what borrowers think about LoanDepot.</p><p>In general, former customers had many positive things to say about their experiences with this lender.</p><h3>Good Communication, Easy to Work With</h3><p>We read a lot of glowing reviews from borrowers who found their loan officers to be knowledgeable, friendly, and easy to reach. This is especially important if you&#39;re looking to buy a home, when things can move fast and you don&#39;t want to be waiting for your lender to pick up the phone before a deal can go through.&nbsp;</p><h3>Smooth Process</h3><p>Former borrowers also said the professionals they worked with helped make the process as easy as possible for them, handling questions or issues in a timely manner and doing extra work to ensure they got a good deal.</p><h3>Convenient Online Process</h3><p>Borrowers also noted that LoanDepot&#39;s website is easy to use and made the application process simple and convenient.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Compare LoanDepot">Comparing LoanDepot to Competitors</h2><h3><strong>LoanDepot vs. Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/fairway-independent-mortgage-corporation-review">Fairway Independent Mortgage</a> is one of the best mortgage lenders and a good choice for renovation loans, offering conventional renovation loans as well as renovation options for all of its government-backed mortgage options, including VA loans and USDA loans.</p><p>Fairway is the clear choice if you&#39;re specifically looking for a reverse mortgage, USDA loan, or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/physician-mortgage-loans">physician loan</a> &mdash; LoanDepot doesn&#39;t offer any of these types of home loans.</p><p>Both lenders have online applications, though LoanDepot is more known for its digital tools, so you might prefer LoanDepot if you&#39;re looking for a super streamlined online process.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/fairway-independent-mortgage-corporation-review">Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation Review</a></em></p><h3><strong>LoanDepot vs. Guild Mortgage</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/guild-mortgage-review">Guild Mortgage</a> is one of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/best-mortgage-lenders-first-time-buyers">best mortgage lenders for first-time buyers</a> thanks to its ample offerings and flexible credit requirements for borrowers who don&#39;t have a traditional credit history.&nbsp;</p><p>With Guild&#39;s Complete Rate program, borrowers can use non-traditional credit, such as rent or utility payment history, to apply for a mortgage in lieu of a credit score. LoanDepot doesn&#39;t offer a similar program.&nbsp;</p><p>Both LoanDepot and Guild are solid online lenders and make it easy to get preapproved, so you may want to apply with both just to see which offers you the best deal.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/guild-mortgage-review">Guild Mortgage Review</a></em></p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">LoanDepot FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Is LoanDepot legit?</h3><p class="faq-answer">LoanDepot is a legitimate mortgage lender that&#39;s been in business since 2010.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Does LoanDepot have a good reputation?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, LoanDepot has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and many positive online customer reviews. It has been the subject of a couple of lawsuits in recent years, but it&#39;s overall a reputable company and one of the largest mortgage lenders in the US.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How does LoanDepot&#39;s application process work?</h3><p class="faq-answer">You can apply with LoanDepot using its convenient online digital tools, or you can get started in person at a branch or over the phone.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What are people saying about LoanDepot?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Previous borrowers have generally praised LoanDepot and its loan officers for being professional, easy to work with, and communicative.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What makes LoanDepot a good choice for mortgage borrowers?</h3><p class="faq-answer">LoanDepot is a good choice for borrowers who want a convenient, digital-friendly experience.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Are LoanDepot&#39;s mortgage rates competitive?</h3><p class="faq-answer">LoanDepot&#39;s mortgage rates are a bit low compared to other lenders, according to HMDA data.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How does LoanDepot compare to other lenders?</h3><p class="faq-answer">LoanDepot is an overall good mortgage lender, but its offerings are relatively limited compared to some lenders.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us">Why You Should Trust Us: How We Reviewed LoanDepot</h2><p>To review LoanDepot, we used <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/how-we-evaluate-mortgage-lenders" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-we-evaluate-mortgage-lenders">our methodology for reviewing mortgage lenders</a>.</p><p>We look at four factors &mdash; loan types, affordability, customer satisfaction, and trustworthiness &mdash; and give each a rating between 1 and 5, then average these individual ratings for the overall lender rating.

For example, if rates are rising, banks will have to raise their rates as well in order to stay competitive. And when rates lower, banks can lower their own rates and still make a profit.</p><h3>Fed Actions and Interest Rate Outlook</h3><p>If you&#39;re wondering <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/investing/what-is-the-federal-reserve">what the Federal Reserve is,</a> also called &#34;the Fed,&#34; it&#39;s the central banking system of the U.S. Multiple times a year, the Fed meets to set its own interest rates. When it announces the changes it makes, most financial institutions follow suit.</p><h3>Individual Institution Rates</h3><p>What rate you can get differs from bank to bank and credit union to credit union. The worst banks for CDs will offer rates as low as 0.01%, while the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-banks">best banks</a> for CDs can go over 5% annual percentage yield. When shopping for 2-year CDs, make sure to compare banks&#39; rates and look for 2-year CD specials.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Should You Invest?">Should You Invest in a 2-Year CD?</h2><p>Whether you should invest in a 2-year CD or not largely depends on what you&#39;re hoping to get from a CD. If you&#39;re purely interested in the highest interest rate, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/short-term-cd-rates">short-term CDs are offering better rates than long-term CDs</a> right now.</p><p>If you&#39;re interested in locking in a high rate for a while without committing to a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-5-year-cd-rates">5-year CD</a>, a 2-year CD might be a good choice for you. You also might like a 2-year CD if you&#39;re saving up for something that you know will happen in two years, such as if you&#39;re planning on buying a house in two years.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">2-Year CD FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Who has the highest paying 2-year CD right now?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The best 2-year CD rate available around the U.S. is 4.55% APY from EFCU Financial.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Are 2-year CDs worth it? </strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">A 2-year CD may be worthwhile if you have a specific <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/savings-goals">savings goal</a> with a timeframe of 2 years and you do not need immediate access to your money. Some 2-year CD rates are as high as 5% APY. Keep in mind that traditional CDs and variable-rate CDs do not allow additional deposits and involve a penalty if you take out any money before a CD term ends.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>What is a 2-year CD?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">A 2-year traditional CD is a savings vehicle offered by banks and credit unions that typically pays a fixed rate over time. You cannot access your money before the 24 months is up without paying a penalty. You have the option to renew your CD at the end of the 2-year period, or close the account and pocket the money.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Are 2-year CD rates generally a &#34;sweet spot&#34; between higher returns and flexibility?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The best CD term length will likely depend on how soon you plan to need the money and which term pays the highest rate. Right now, short-term CDs offer higher rates because people expect the Fed to lower rates this year. Going with a longer-term CD might let you lock in a rate before it drops, though. A 2-year CD might let you lock in a higher rate while still getting a strong rate now.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>How much difference in rates is typical between a 1-year and 2-year CD?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The difference between 2-year CD rates vs 1-year CD rates will differ depending on financial institution and market changes. Right now, you can generally expect 1-year CD rates to be higher than 2-year CD rates.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Should I always choose the absolute highest 2-year CD rate?</h3><p class="faq-answer">While high rates are important when choosing 2-year CDs, it&#39;s likely you&#39;ll want to consider other factors as well, such as minimum opening deposits, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/cd-early-withdrawal-penalties">early withdrawal penalties</a>, and limits on how much you can earn.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us">Why You Should Trust Us: Experts&#39; Advice on Choosing the Best 2-Year CD</h2><p>We consulted four banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best place to keep your money.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/65f30d7d3037f8e81750540e?format=jpeg" height="433" width="1200" charset="" alt="PFI Banking Expert Panel (updated Mar 2024); (from left to right) Tania Brown; Roger Ma; Sophia Acevedo; Mykail James"/><figcaption><p class="copyright">BI</p></figcaption></figure><ul><li>Tania Brown, CFPÂ® professional and vice president of coaching strategy at <a href="https://www.ofcolor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-mrf-link="https://www.ofcolor.com/">OfColor</a></li><li>Sophia Acevedo, banking editor, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="06d5d843a1e77bf6ad8215a6e4467c89" data-analytics-module="body_link">Business Insider</a></li><li>Roger Ma, CFPÂ® professional and author of <span>&#34;Work Your Money, Not Your Life&#34;</span></li><li>Mykail James, MBA, certified financial education instructor, <a href="https://www.boujiebudgets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="2cf30a6077693f0e2adb1334f9258693" data-analytics-module="body_link">BoujieBudgets.com</a></li></ul><p>Here&#39;s their insight about CDs.</p><p><strong>How can someone choose between all of the available banks and credit unions?</strong></p><p>First of all, you want a bank that is FDIC-insured (or a credit union that is NCUA-insured). Then, consider your own priorities: Are you looking for an in-person banking experience? Do you need a high-tech mobile app? Do you write checks? Are you looking for a high interest rate? Will you meet the requirements to waive any monthly maintenance fees?</p><p>There are plenty of banks and credit unions that offer good rates and useful products, but the best one for you will come down to how it fits your needs.</p><p><strong>How should you choose a term length for a CD?</strong></p><p>When you put money in a CD, you want to have two things: a plan for how you will use that money, and a timeline for when you&#39;ll do it. Once you know when you&#39;ll spend it, take a look at rates for terms that are near your planned timeline, and choose the CD with the best rate.</p><p><strong>When you can put money in high-yield savings account, money market account, or CD, how do you choose between them?</strong></p><p>While all three options pay somewhat similar rates, the difference comes down to how you plan to interact with that money over time. If you need access to it in the next few months or years, that means you can&#39;t use a CD (or at least not one that spans however many months or years). Money market accounts tend to offer more account accessibility &mdash; several offer paper checks, ATM cards, or debit cards &mdash; while high-yield savings accounts are a good place to leave your money alone, knowing you can access it if needed.</p><p><strong>Methodology: How We Selected the Best 2-Year CDs</strong></p><p>At Business Insider, we aim to create helpful reviews, guides, and explainers so that you can make smart money decisions.

They manage monetary policy by assessing economic conditions.</p><p>When monetary policy changes, banks will often change bank interest rates. For CDs specifically, CD rates will increase during rate increases, and CD rates will decline during rate drops.&nbsp;</p><h3>Economic Projections</h3><p>Experts anticipate that CD rates will drop in 2024. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-cuts-interest-rates-how-much-september-fomc-powell-inflation-2024-9">Fed cut interest rates for the first time in four years</a> in September, which will impact CD rates and stir declines at many banks. That said, the rate at which bank account rates decline varies by bank and you can still lock in a high rate before rates fall more.</p><h3>Institution Specific Rates</h3><p>Banks also have their own specific criteria for adjusting CD rates. You might occasionally see that banks pay the highest rates for 18-month terms or offer special promotional CDs for certain customers.</p><p>If you&#39;re interested in CD promotions, be mindful of the requirements necessary to earn the special rate. Sometimes, there are limitations on how much money you can deposit, or you have to deposit &#34;new money.&#34; Each bank will define what &#34;new money&#34; is, but generally, it means you have to deposit money from another bank.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to Find the Best 18-Month CD for You">How to Find the Best 18-Month CD for You</h2><p>Interest rates are always important when choosing an 18-month CD, but there are other factors to consider, too. Look at the CD&#39;s minimum opening deposit. If you don&#39;t have enough money to open the 18-month CD with the highest rate, it&#39;s probably still worth opening one that has a minimum deposit requirement you can afford, even if it pays a little less.</p><p>You should also look at the bank&#39;s early withdrawal penalty for 18-month terms. A high penalty for withdrawing money early could cancel out any interest you&#39;ve already earned. If you&#39;re worried about needing money early, search for a bank that charges lower penalties. Or it might be better to put your money in a shorter-term CD, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-no-penalty-cds">no-penalty CD</a>, or high-yield savings account instead.</p><h3>Pros and Cons of 18-Month CDs</h3><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;">Pros</td><td style="width: 50%;">Cons</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li><p>Best 18-month CD rates are comparable to high-yield savings rates</p></li><li><p>Guaranteed rate of return for 18 months</p></li><li><p>If rates go down, you keep the higher rate you have now</p></li><li><p>Funds are insured by the FDIC</p></li><li><p>Early withdrawal penalties may help you resist temptation to spend your savings</p></li><li><p>Lower risk than the stock market</p></li></ul></td><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>If rates go up, you keep the lower rate you&#39;ve locked in until the term ends</li><li>You can&#39;t add more money after the initial deposit</li><li>Early withdrawal penalties</li><li>Potentially lower returns than the stock market</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 data-toc-label="Should You Open an 18-month CD?">Should You Open an 18-month CD?</h2><p>You can earn a great rate on an 18-month CD right now, and you&#39;ll lock in that rate for the entire term. This means your rate is fixed, so it won&#39;t increase or decrease even if the bank changes its 18-month rates. This can be a disadvantage if the bank raises rates, but it&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/are-cd-rates-going-up">unlikely that CD rates will go up in 2024</a>&nbsp;anyway.</p><p>Although the best 18-month CD rates are similar to the many high-yield savings rates right now, CDs come with less flexibility than savings accounts. Most banks don&#39;t allow you to put more money into your CD after the initial deposit, and they charge you a penalty for taking out money before the term ends.</p><p>CDs offer a guaranteed rate of return, which means they&#39;re much less risky than investing your money in the stock market. You could earn more with the stock market, but the market is unpredictable, so you could actually end up losing money over that 18 months instead. Because 18 months is a relatively short amount of time, you may want to put the money in a CD instead to be on the safe side.</p><h3>Alternatives to a 18-Month CD</h3><p><strong>18-Month CD vs. Shorter-Term CD</strong></p><p>It&#39;s common for banks to offer 6-month and 1-year CDs, and many even have 3-month terms. These are great options if you can&#39;t part with your money for the full 18 months. Also, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-6-month-cd-rates">6-month CD rates</a> and 1-year CD rates are comparable to &mdash; and often higher than &mdash; 18-month rates right now.</p><p>Because rates on 6-month, 1-year, and 18-month CDs are especially high at this point, you might be interested in building a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/cd-ladder">CD ladder</a>. This involves dividing your money between several CD terms so you can access it at different times. For example, you could open a 6-month, 1-year, and 18-month CD, and you&#39;d have access to your money and earned interest after six, 12, and 18 months.</p><p>This strategy helps you avoid some risk. If you put all of your money into an 18-month CD with plans to put it back into another 18-month CD after the term ends, rates may be lower by then. By building a ladder, though, you lock in high rates now before they potentially drop later.</p><p><strong>18-Month CD vs. Longer-Term CD</strong></p><p>You may want to put money into a longer CD term if you know you won&#39;t need it for more than 18 months. Plenty of online institutions are paying great rates on terms up to five years. However, the best rates on 18-month CDs and shorter terms are higher than rates on longer terms right now.</p><p><strong>18-Month CD vs. High-Yield Savings Account</strong></p><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-high-yield-savings-accounts-rates-right-now">best high-yield savings accounts</a> are paying similar rates to the best 18-month CDs. But you still might prefer a high-yield savings account over a CD for two reasons: You can deposit money at any time, and you can often withdraw money without paying a penalty. CDs and savings accounts are both great tools for saving money, so there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t open both.</p><p><strong>18-Month CD vs. Money Market Account</strong></p><p>Money market accounts are similar to savings accounts, except most include perks you&#39;d normally get with checking accounts, such as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/atm-cards-vs-debit-cards">ATM cards, debit cards,</a>&nbsp;or paper checks. Money market accounts make it much easier to access your savings than CDs. The best money market accounts pay great rates right now, but they&#39;re still not as high as the best 18-month CD rates. A money market account could be a good fit if you want easier access to your savings, while an 18-month CD might be better if you want help resisting the temptation to spend your savings.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">18-Month CD FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Who has the highest paying 18-month CD right now?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Eaglebank has the highest CD rates for an 18-month term.

If it&#39;s supposed to be a house fund, and you want to wait for another two years to buy a house, that&#39;s what you should be thinking of when you want to have this money.&#34;</p><p><strong>How should someone decide whether to put their money in a high-yield savings account, money market account, or CD?</strong></p><p><strong>Tania Brown, CFPÂ® professional:</strong></p><p>&#34;So I guess we&#39;ll start off with how much money you want to put in and ... the level of transactions you want to have. If you want to have any transactions, that automatically takes out CDs. Then you&#39;re stuck between the high-yield savings and the money market account.&#34;</p><p><strong>Sophia Acevedo, Business Insider:</strong></p><p>&#34;Generally, I think a high-yield savings account or money market account could be good options for an emergency fund or short-term savings goals. A high-yield savings account offers a higher interest rate than traditional savings accounts at brick-and-mortar banks. Meanwhile, money market accounts might be worth considering if you want more account accessibility &mdash; several offer paper checks, ATM cards, or debit cards. CDs could be worthwhile if you don&#39;t need access to some of your money, since they have a fixed interest rate for a specific term.&#34;</p><p><strong>Methodology: How we Chose the Best 18-Month CD Rates</strong></p><p>At Business Insider, our goal is to create helpful reviews, guides, and explainers so that you can make good decisions about your money. We recognize every person has distinct preferences, so we provide ample options to help you find the most suitable financial product or account.</p><p>Our team is editorially independent &mdash; our business team does not decide how we cover products or what we write about.

We&#39;ve reviewed each institution to find the most-well rounded banking options.</p><p>When we rate a bank account, we use a scale of zero to five stars. A one-star rating is a low score that indicates the product needs significant improvement. A five-star rating is the highest rating possible and indicates the product is a superior choice.&nbsp;</p><p>We analyze specific features of CDs. We compare the minimum opening deposits, early withdrawal penalties, and interest rates. We also considered the overall banking experience at each bank by assessing customer support availability, mobile app ratings, and ethics. Each CD feature we assess is scored 0 from 5. We get the average of these scores to calculate the account&#39;s total rating.

To become a member of Kitsap Credit Union, you or a family member must live, work, go to school, or worship in the state of Washington.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Both credit unions have solid high-yield checking accounts that do not charge monthly service fees. Your choice between the two might boil down to whether you qualify to earn a competitive interest rate at a particular institution.</p><p>At Kitsap Credit Union, you&#39;ll be able to earn 3.30% APY on the first $15,000 of your checking account balance if you enroll in online bank statements, make 12 debit card transactions each month, and make at least one <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/ach-transfer">ACH transfer</a>, direct deposit, or bill payment per month.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gesa Credit Union lets you earn 7.00% APY on the first $5,000 in a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/gesa-credit-union-review">Gesa Credit Union Gesa Credit Union SmartPlus Checking Account</a> if you enroll in online statements and use a valid email address, make a monthly direct deposit of over $200, and make 15 debit card transactions per month.</p><p>Gesa Credit Union also might be an appealing choice if you are looking for CDs with high interest rates. The credit union&#39;s 1-year or 7-year CDs stand out because they pay competitive interest rates higher than the average CD.</p><p><strong>Gesa Credit Union vs. HAPO Community Credit Union</strong></p><p>Deciding between Gesa Credit Union and HAPO Community Credit Union could ultimately depend on where you live.&nbsp;</p><p>To become a member of Gesa Credit Union, you must live in Washington, select counties in Idaho, or select counties in Oregon. In comparison, HAPO Community Credit Union lets you become a member if you or a family member live or work in the state of Washington or select counties in Oregon (Clackamas, Clatsop, Columbia Gillam, Hood River, Morrow, Multnomah, Sherman, Umatilla Wasco, or Washington county).</p><p>You also want to consider which types of accounts you&#39;d like to open. Gesa Credit Union has a high-yield checking account, while HAPO Community Credit Union doesn&#39;t.&nbsp;</p><p>You might lean more toward HAPO Community Credit Union if you&#39;d like to get a share certificate with a low minimum opening deposit, though.</p><h3 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us">Why You Should Trust Us: How We Reviewed Gesa Federal Credit Union&nbsp;</h3><p>For our Gesa Federal Credit Union review, we rated bank products and services using our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-finance-editorial-standards" rel="" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="b4bdc0fc1fb87c12af5225ae7ee062b9" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-finance-editorial-standards">editorial standards</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We rate products on a scale from zero to five stars, and use a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/methodology" rel="" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/methodology">bank account methodology</a></p><p>For example, using our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/methodology" rel="" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/methodology">CD methodology</a>&nbsp;we&#39;ll review interest rates, minimum opening deposit requirements, early withdrawal penalties, CD variety, customer support availability, mobile app ratings, and ethics of the overall company.

Meanwhile, for savings accounts, we&#39;ll factor monthly fees.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How Popular Direct Compares">How Popular Direct Compares</h2><p>We&#39;ve compared Popular Direct to two online-only banks: Marcus and Ally.</p><h3>Popular Direct review vs. Marcus review</h3><p>Both Popular Direct and Marcus have savings accounts and CDs, but no checking account. Both banks require you to transfer money to an external account to access your savings.</p><p>Marcus is the better choice for low minimum deposits. Marcus has a $0 minimum deposit requirement for its savings account, and a $500 minimum for CDs &mdash; Popular Direct asks for $100 to open a savings account, and $10,000 to open a CD. Along with the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/marcus-cd-rates">Marcus High-Yield CD</a>, there&#39;s also a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/marcus-cd-rates">Marcus No-Penalty CD</a> that doesn&#39;t charge a fee when you withdraw funds before your CD matures. If you&#39;re interested in a no-penalty CD, then Marcus is the way to go.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/marcus-bank-review">Marcus Bank Review</a> </em></p><h3>Popular Direct review vs. Ally review</h3><p>Popular Direct pays higher interest rates on savings accounts and most CDs.</p><p>Unlike Popular Direct, Ally has a checking account. This makes it much easier to access your savings. All you have to do is transfer money from savings to checking, and you can spend the funds almost instantly.</p><p>Ally is the clear option if you don&#39;t have thousands of dollars for an opening deposit with Popular Direct. Ally doesn&#39;t require minimum deposits for any of its accounts.</p><p>You might like Ally&#39;s CD options. There&#39;s an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/ally-cd-review">Ally High Yield CD</a> that&#39;s similar to the Popular Direct CD. There&#39;s also an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/ally-cd-review">Ally No Penalty CD</a> and an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/ally-cd-review">Ally Raise Your Rate CD</a>.

When the Fed raises the federal funds rate, CD rates will often rise. Conversely, CD rates will often fall when the Fed cuts the federal funds rate.</p><h3>Short-Term Economic Outlook</h3><p>While 3-month CDs currently offer higher rates than long-term CDs, like 3-year or 5-year terms, this isn&#39;t usual behavior for these accounts.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/short-term-cd-rates">Short-term CDs are more competitive than long-term CDs</a> because of economic uncertainty. That said, the Fed cut interest rates for the first time in four years in September 2024. More rate cuts are anticipated in the future, which will cause national CD rates to decline overall and for short-term CDs to eventually get less competitive than long-term CDs.</p><h3>Special Promotions</h3><p>Banks are currently offering more promotional CDs with short terms. These offers may be specifically for new customers or for existing customers who have eligible bank accounts.</p><p>One requirement that&#39;s often listed for these promotions is a &#34;new money&#34; specification. Each bank has its own definition for what qualifies as &#34;new money,&#34; but generally, this means you must deposit funds from an external bank account.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Should You Open?">Should You Open a 3-Month CD?</h2><p>A 3-month CD is a strong option for short-term <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/savings-goals">savings goals</a>. It could also be beneficial for building a CD ladder because you&#39;ll be able to take advantage of high short-term CD rates.</p><p>The main disadvantage to opening a 3-month CD is that you need to be more mindful of existing economic conditions. Since short-term CD rates fluctuate more often than long-term ones, you&#39;ll have to assess renewal options more frequently and see if your bank&#39;s offerings are still among the top rates.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">3-Month CD FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;list&#34;,{},&#34;list_item&#34;,{&#34;indent&#34;:1,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;bulleted&#34;}]">What is the highest paying 3-month CD rate?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The highest 3-month CD rate is available at Dow Credit Union and TotalBank.

However, because of economic uncertainty, short-term CDs actually have higher rates than long-term CDs right now. It&#39;s anticipated that the Federal Reserve will cut rates soon, but in the meantime, banks have maintained high rates on short-term CDs to still have competitive offerings.</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;list&#34;,{},&#34;list_item&#34;,{&#34;indent&#34;:1,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;bulleted&#34;}]"><strong>When is a 3-month CD a smart choice?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">Experts recommend choosing a CD term that fits your savings goals. Hence, a 3-month CD could be a smart choice if you want to receive a fixed interest rate for only three months. It could also be a good option if you want to build a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/cd-ladder">CD ladder</a>.</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;list&#34;,{},&#34;list_item&#34;,{&#34;indent&#34;:1,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;bulleted&#34;}]"><strong>Do the best 3-month CD rates change very frequently?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">The best 3-month CD rates change frequently. Our top picks often change several times per month because we review CD rates daily. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/are-cd-rates-going-up">CD forecast for 2024</a> also indicates that CD rates are expected to drop more later in the year, so you should expect the top rates to also change in the future.</p><h3 class="faq-question" data-pm-slice="1 1 [&#34;list&#34;,{},&#34;list_item&#34;,{&#34;indent&#34;:1,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;bulleted&#34;}]"><strong>Are 3-month CDs a good &#34;starter&#34; CD?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">If it&#39;s your first time opening a CD, a 3-month term could be a good choice if it suits your financial goals.

(Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.)</p><p><strong>How do you choose a bank or credit union?</strong></p><p>&#34;You want to make sure it&#39;s FDIC insured,&#34; says Brown. For people using credit unions, the insurance comes from the NCUA. Next, she advises, consider the banking experience you want to have. &#34;Do you like walking into a bank? Well, then you need someone local. Do you just not care if you ever see your bank? Then you&#39;re okay online. Do you write checks? Do you not write checks?&#34; Think through how your experience with that institution would be before you make that decision.</p><p>Acevedo recommends factoring in account costs when you&#39;re envisioning your experience with a bank or credit union. &#34;For example,&#34; she says, &#34;some banks have accounts that charge monthly service fees. I would look to see what the requirements are for waiving the monthly service fee and whether I think I could feasibly meet those requirements each month.&#34; Or if she was searching for an interest-earning bank account, she would make sure it pays a higher interest rate than the average bank account.</p><p><strong>How long should you leave money in a CD?</strong></p><p>&#34;I would think about when you need the money and then compare that with what the prevailing CD rates are,&#34; says Ma. Then, he continues, consider what makes sense not only from a financial perspective, but from your own personal timing perspective. If the rates are highest on a 2-year CD but you need the money in six months, don&#39;t sacrifice your plans for interest.</p><p>Your plans are important to the CD term you choose, says James. &#34;I believe in having a plan for whatever the funds are,&#34; she says. &#34;If it&#39;s supposed to be a house fund, and you want to wait for another two years to buy a house, that&#39;s what you should be thinking of when you want to have this money.&#34;</p><p><strong>Methodology: How We Selected the Best 3-Month CDs</strong></p><p>Business Insider&#39;s personal finance team is editorially independent, which means our business team does not decide how we cover products and what we write about. Our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-finance-editorial-standards" rel="" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-mrf-link="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-finance-editorial-standards">editorial standards page</a> covers how we review and choose products in greater detail.&nbsp;</p><p>For our best 3-month CD rates guide, we researched over 60 banks and credit unions to find the best 3-month CD rates. We reviewed each institution to find the most-well rounded banking options.&nbsp;</p><p>We use our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/methodology">bank account rating methodology</a>&nbsp;to assess every bank account. We rate bank products on a scale of zero to five stars. A one-star rating indicates that a bank account requires significant improvement, while an account with a five-star rating is seen as a superior choice.&nbsp;</p><p>We analyze specific features for different types of bank accounts. For CDs, we compare the minimum opening deposits, early withdrawal penalties, and interest rates. We also evaluate each bank&#39;s overall banking experience by assessing customer support availability, mobile app ratings, and ethics. Each feature is scored from 0 to 5. We add up these scores and get the average to determine the account&#39;s total rating.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-3-month-cd-rates">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

The account offers a strong interest rate and no monthly service fee, but not everyone can open it. The account is also missing some features you might have come to expect from an online bank account.</p><div class="insider-raw-embed" data-type="embed" data-embed-type="raw" id="6caf2d7a-5913-4856-8de2-4c5e354f2581"><script async="" src="https://static.myfinance.com/embed/myFinance.js"></script><div class="myFinance-widget" data-ad-id="5f32fec1-0d7c-4fdd-b426-e6362cfd37e0" data-campaign="business-insider-santander-spl" data-sub-id="PLACESUBIDHERE"></div></div><h2 data-toc-label="Rates and Features">Openbank Savings Account Rates and Features</h2><p>Openbank only has one product: Openbank High Yield Savings. The Openbank High Yield Savings account comes with an interest rate of 5.25% (vary depending on location) APY, which is much higher than the average savings rate and on par with the highest interest rates that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-online-banks">online banks</a> offer. The banks also charges no monthly fees.</p><p>You won&#39;t have to pay for incoming or outgoing domestic <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/how-to-wire-money-send-receive-cash-immediately">wire transfers</a>, which is rare even among online banks. Wire transfers are expensive, and most banks charge you a fee for outgoing wire transfers. If you think you&#39;ll need to send wire transfers frequently, this might be a good bank account for you.</p><p>The bank doesn&#39;t charge overdraft fees, but it also doesn&#39;t let you overdraft your account at all. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-banks-for-overdrafts">best banks for avoiding overdraft</a> provide overdraft protection services for free.</p><p>You will need at least $500 to put in your account as a minimum opening deposit. That&#39;s high for a high-yield savings account. You&#39;ll also need to be comfortable banking using a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-mobile-banking-apps">mobile banking app</a>. Openbank requires you to use its app to bank; it also requires your phone to have fingerprint or face recognition technology to use said app. If you don&#39;t have a phone that offers those features, or if you&#39;re uncomfortable banking from your phone, you might want to go with a different bank.</p><p>You might also find it hard to move money in and out of your account. You won&#39;t be able to withdraw or deposit money into your account through an ATM, and the mobile app does not currently offer <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/how-to-mobile-deposit-a-check">mobile check deposit</a>. Openbank is still relatively new, though, so it&#39;s possible this will change once the bank has been around longer. The app has mediocre reviews on the Google Play store; since you&#39;ll need to use the app to bank, you might not want to bank here if you have an Android phone.</p><div class="insider-raw-embed" data-type="embed" data-embed-type="raw" id="f8bb1621-fab7-4029-9788-6d34e6aca726"><script async="" src="https://static.myfinance.com/embed/myFinance.js"></script><div class="myFinance-widget" data-ad-id="5f32fec1-0d7c-4fdd-b426-e6362cfd37e0" data-campaign="business-insider-santander-spl" data-sub-id="PLACESUBIDHERE"></div></div><h2 data-toc-label="Openbank and Santander Bank">Openbank and Santander Bank</h2><p>Openbank is an online division of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/santander-bank-review">Santander Bank</a>. This means you won&#39;t have to worry as much about the bank failing, since it&#39;s backed up by a much larger, more long-running bank. This does come with some downsides, though. Current Santander Bank customers with bank accounts or loans won&#39;t be able to use Openbank. People who live in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island &mdash; the states where Santander Bank operates &mdash; also won&#39;t be able to open an account with Openbank.</p><p>If you have an Openbank High Yield Savings account, you won&#39;t be able to manage it at a Santander Bank branch. If you want to talk to a customer service representative, Openbank does have a customer service phone line you can call from 8:00 a.m. ET to 8:00 p.m. ET from Monday through Saturday &mdash; not <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/banks-with-24-7-customer-support">24/7 customer service</a>, but still extended past regular bank hours. You can only use the phone line if you&#39;re a current customer.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Pros and Cons">Openbank Savings Account Pros and Cons</h2><h3>Openbank Savings Account Pros</h3><ul><li>High interest rate</li><li>No <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/monthly-bank-maintenance-fee">monthly bank maintenance fees</a></li><li>Free wire transfers</li><li>Backed by Santander Bank</li></ul><h3>Openbank Savings Account Cons</h3><ul><li>High minimum opening deposit</li><li>No mobile check deposit</li><li>Interest is compounded monthly</li><li>People who are Santander Bank customers or who live in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, or Rhode Island cannot open an account</li><li>Have to use a mobile banking app, which has mediocre ratings on the Google Play store</li><li>Have to have a phone with face and fingerprint recognition to open an account</li><li>No overdraft protection</li></ul><h2 data-toc-label="Who is It Best For?">Who is the Openbank Savings Account Best For?</h2><p>The Openbank Savings Account is best for people who want a high-yield savings account with a high interest rate and who want to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/how-to-avoid-bank-fees">avoid bank fees</a>, especially if you&#39;re an Apple user. If you prefer to bank from your phone, this could also be a good bank for you.</p><p>If you don&#39;t have a phone with the features Openbank requires, if you want an account that&#39;s easier to get money in and out of, or if you want all of your bank accounts with one bank, Openbank won&#39;t be the choice for you. Openbank doesn&#39;t currently offer other types of bank accounts, like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-checking-accounts">checking accounts</a> or CDs. People who are already Santander Bank customers or who live in one of the states Santander operates in will also need to go with another bank.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Alternatives">Openbank Savings Alternatives</h2><h3>Openbank Savings vs. Ally Savings</h3><p>If you want to do all of your banking with one online bank, you&#39;ll prefer the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/ally-high-yield-savings-account-review">Ally Savings Account</a>; Ally offers several different types of bank accounts, while Openbank only offers one. Ally also has more perks, such as being a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/savings-accounts-to-save-for-goals">savings account with buckets</a>.</p><p>If you&#39;re hoping to get the highest interest rate possible, you&#39;ll probably want to go with Openbank. The Openbank High Yield Savings account interest rate is 5.25% (vary depending on location) APY, while the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/ally-high-yield-savings-account-review">Ally Savings account</a> only offers an interest rate of 4.00% APY.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/ally-bank-review">Ally Bank Review</a></em></p><h3>Openbank Savings vs. Jenius Bank Savings</h3><p>Openbank and Jenius Bank are similar in that they are both online banks that offer a high-yield savings account with a strong interest rate, and neither of them offers many products overall. If you&#39;re looking to open a loan, you might prefer Jenius Bank; Jenius also offers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/personal-loans/best-personal-loans">personal loans</a>, while Openbank only offers its savings account.</p><p>If you want the highest interest rate on an online savings account, you&#39;ll still probably want to go with Openbank. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/jenius-bank-review">Jenius Savings Account</a> has an interest rate of 5.05% APY. While still very high, it doesn&#39;t quite beat out Openbank&#39;s rate.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/jenius-bank-review#:~:text=Business%20Insider&#39;s%20personal%20finance%20team,rates%20available%20and%20no%20fees.">Jenius Bank Review</a></em></p><h2 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us">Why You Should Trust Us: How We Reviewed Openbank Savings</h2><p>At Business Insider, we use our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/methodology">bank rating methodology</a> to rate each bank or banking product we review. For savings accounts, we first give several account features a rating from 0 to 5. These features include customer support, interest rates, monthly service fees, minimum opening deposits, mobile banking app ratings, and bank ethics. Once we&#39;ve given each feature a rating, we average the feature scores together to get the overall rating for the savings account.</p><p>When a bank is a strong choice for underserved banking populations, we highlight that in our review. Examples include <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/best-second-chance-bank-accounts">second chance banks</a>, which help people with poor credit open bank accounts; minority depository institutions and community development financial institutions, which provide financial services to underbanked communities; and the best banks for immigrants, which let you use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number and foreign IDs to apply for an account. We also highlight eco-friendly banks, which help the environment with the money you put into your bank account.</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Openbank Savings FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Is my money safe in Openbank?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, your money is safe in Openbank.

According to Business Insider&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/what-are-points-miles-worth-value">points valuations</a>, Ultimate Rewards have an average value of 1.8 cents apiece.</p><p>I have half a dozen Chase cards that earn Ultimate Rewards points, but my Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® is the &#34;one card to rule them all.&#34;</p><p>I funnel points earned from my other cards to the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® for additional value, either by sending them to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-ultimate-rewards-points-transfer-partners">Chase Ultimate Rewards point transfer partners</a> or by redeeming them through Chase Travel for 1.5 cents apiece.&nbsp;</p><p>The other Ultimate Rewards-earning cards in my wallet include the Ink Business PreferredÂ® Credit Card,&nbsp;Ink Business UnlimitedÂ® Credit Card<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-ink-business-unlimited-credit-card-review"></a><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-ink-business-cash-credit-card-review"></a>,&nbsp; Ink Business CashÂ® Credit Card<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-ink-business-cash-credit-card-review"></a>, Chase Freedom UnlimitedÂ®<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-freedom-unlimited-review"></a>, and Chase Freedom FlexÂ®<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-freedom-flex-credit-card-review"></a>.</p><h3><strong>Welcome Bonus</strong></h3><p>Earning a welcome bonus is the quickest way to jump-start or boost your stash of points. The Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® currently offers a welcome bonus of 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. This bonus is worth&nbsp;108000 in travel when you transfer points to airline and hotel partners.</p><p>I personally think this bonus is just average in the world of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-current-credit-card-signup-bonuses">credit card welcome offers</a>, sometimes also called sign-up bonuses. While some credit cards are worth opening for the welcome offer alone, I typically earn this many points on my card each year just by using my Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® for all dining and travel expenses.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The Sapphire credit cards have some of the strictest restrictions within the Chase family. If you already have the&nbsp;Chase Sapphire PreferredÂ® Card, you can&#39;t also get a Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® (or vice versa); you&#39;ll need to downgrade or cancel the card you already have. You also won&#39;t be eligible for a new welcome bonus if you got your last Sapphire card within the past 48 months (four years).</p><h3>Using Chase Ultimate Rewards</h3><p>I can transfer points from my Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® and other Chase cards to more than a dozen of the world&#39;s best-known airlines and hotels:</p><ul><li>Aer Lingus</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/how-to-earn-use-air-canada-aeroplan-miles-points" rel="noopener">Air Canada</a></li><li>Air France-KLM</li><li>British Airways</li><li>Iberia</li><li>Emirates</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/how-to-earn-redeem-hyatt-points" rel="noopener">Hyatt</a></li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/how-to-earn-use-ihg-points" rel="noopener" data-analytics-post-depth="0" data-uri="9cf7b4ab4b8f150274a0c84007191d41">IHG</a></li><li>JetBlue</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/how-to-earn-redeem-marriott-points" rel="noopener" data-analytics-post-depth="0" data-uri="fd21a560134a39290e6e8304bd40e05d">Marriott</a></li><li>Singapore Airlines</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/how-to-earn-redeem-southwest-points" rel="noopener">Southwest</a></li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/how-to-earn-use-united-mileageplus-miles" rel="noopener" data-analytics-post-depth="0" data-uri="1615da9eadc70f215302708b56bc8600">United</a></li><li>Virgin Atlantic</li></ul><p>I regularly transfer points to Air Canada, Southwest, United, and Hyatt, and semi-occasionally use Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic. In my six years as a Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® cardholder, the only partners I haven&#39;t utilized have been Aer Lingus and Iberia.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® Benefits">Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® Benefits</h2><p>Despite the high annual fee, the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® has a lot to offer.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-toc-label="My Favorite Perk: The Most Comprehensive Credit Card Travel Insurance You&#39;ll Find"><strong>My Favorite Perk: The Most Comprehensive Credit Card Travel Insurance You&#39;ll Find</strong></h3><p>The &#34;best&#34; perk is also the most technical benefit to discuss. Nobody gets excited about insurance, but it&#39;s one of the best blessings in the world in the unlucky chance that you need it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®&#39;s travel insurance is among the most generous travel insurance coverage of any credit card, so it&#39;s a great choice for booking flights and other transportation.</p><p>I highly value the travel insurance and purchase coverage that comes with this credit card. In fact, a single claim from a 2018 trip saved me more than $1,800 out of pocket on a chaotic three-week Italy trip.</p><p>I&#39;ve reviewed a number of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/travel-insurance">travel insurance</a> plans and providers throughout my career and have even purchased annual travel insurance policies in the past. However, the travel insurance from the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® has covered 95% of my needs.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Primary Car Rental Insurance</strong></h4><p>This card offers primary rental car insurance when I use the card to pay for a rental car. Primary coverage means that I don&#39;t need to file claims for damage, loss, or collisions through my personal auto insurance policy, as long as I&#39;ve paid for the rental car with my Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®.</p><p>Liability insurance isn&#39;t included in this benefit, so you may still want to purchase liability coverage through the rental car company.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> As of October 2024, New York state residents with auto insurance policies are no longer eligible for primary coverage on rental cars although you&#39;ll still have secondary coverage. If you live in New York but don&#39;t have a car insurance policy, you still qualify for primary rental car protection.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Trip Interruption/Cancellation Insurance</strong></p><p>If you&#39;ve paid for an eligible trip with the card and it&#39;s cut short or canceled for a covered reason such as illness or severe weather, you can be reimbursed up to $10,000 per person and $20,000 per trip for pre-paid, non-refundable travel expenses.</p><p>I used this benefit to help me rebook travel from Chicago to Venice in 2018, when my original flight was canceled altogether. Although United helped me get a new flight to Rome, I lost my original flight from Rome to Venice in the shuffle. The insurance from my Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® covered the cost of booking a new flight.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Trip Delay Insurance</strong></p><p>If you pay for travel with this card, your trip delay insurance benefit can reimburse you up to $500 per ticket for hotel rooms, food, toiletries, clothes, or other reasonable expenses when your flight is delayed overnight or by six hours or more.</p><p>It also helped me pay for new train tickets and a hotel in Florence when a train strike derailed my itinerary halfway through the trip.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Baggage Delay Insurance</strong></h4><p>If you pay for your trip with the card and your bags are delayed for six hours or more, you could be reimbursed for essential purchases (like clothing and toiletries) up to $100 per day for up to five days.</p><p>This benefit helped me replace several hundred dollars of lost clothing during the Italy trip when my bags were stranded on a different plane due to summer thunderstorms. It took six days for my luggage to reach me, during which I maxed out the $500 allowance.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Lost Luggage Reimbursement</strong></h4><p>If the airline damages or loses your bags, you and your immediate family members could be covered for up to $3,000 per passenger if you&#39;ve paid for your tickets with the card.</p><p>This clause of the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®&#39;s travel insurance benefits has helped me replace two separate suitcases at different times: Once for a cracked shell, and once for a broken telescoping handle.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Additional Benefits</strong></h4><p>I&#39;ve never had to use any of the following benefits (knock on wood). But they&#39;re always great to know about, just in case:</p><ul><li><strong>Travel accident insurance</strong> &mdash; When you pay for your air, bus, cruise, or train transportation with the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®, you&#39;re eligible for accidental death or dismemberment coverage of up to $1,000,000.</li><li><strong>Roadside assistance &mdash; </strong><span></span>Reserve cardholders can contact the roadside assistance hotline for help with a tow, jumpstart, tire change, lock</li><li><strong>Emergency evacuation/transportation &mdash; </strong>Cardholders and their immediate family members can access an emergency evacuation and transportation benefit of up to $100,000 in coverage if they&#39;re injured or become critically ill during a covered trip of between five and 60 days. The evacuation must be approved by Chase&#39;s benefits administrator in consultation with a licensed physician.</li><li><strong>Emergency medical and dental benefits &mdash;</strong> Supplements any existing medical coverage I have if I&#39;m injured or get sick on a trip of five to 60 days. There&#39;s a maximum benefit of $2,500 with a $50 deductible. If I need to recover in a hotel, I&#39;m can be covered for costs up to $75 per day for up to five days.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The Chase Sapphire PreferredÂ® Card has a much lower annual fee of $95, and comes with most of these travel insurance benefits, sometimes with lower tiers of coverage. For the price point, that card is a far better deal for most people who want some backup protection but who don&#39;t travel frequently enough to justify a premium card like the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®</p><p>Read more in our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/chase-sapphire-preferred-card-review">Chase Sapphire Preferred card review</a>, or look at our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-sapphire-preferred-reserve-credit-card-comparison">Chase Sapphire Preferred vs. Reserve card comparison</a> to see which one makes the most sense for your own travel and financial needs.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Lyft Pink All Access Membership</strong></h3><p>I&#39;ve been a Lyft-exclusive rider since 2018, thanks to the partnership between Chase and Lyft. Because I earn 10 Chase points per dollar on Lyft transactions when I pay with the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®, I only use Uber when I&#39;m traveling abroad or have a discount code (or credit card benefit).&nbsp;</p><p>As a Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® cardholder, I also get two years of complimentary Lyft Pink All Access membership. This is Lyft&#39;s most premium membership plan, worth $199 per year, and comes with excellent perks such as member-exclusive pricing, cancellation forgiveness, priority pickup upgrades, unlimited bike rides, and more.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Rental Car Discounts and Perks with Avis, National, and Silvercar&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® cardholders get special privileges on Avis, National, and Silvercar car rentals, including complimentary elite status. Benefits vary between the three companies but typically include a car class upgrade, easy pick-up/drop-off, discounts, savings on luxury and premium cars, and special promotions</p><p>I don&#39;t use these benefits often, but my friends who have kids or specific rental vehicle requirements tell me that the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®&#39;s rental car benefits are very valuable for them.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>$300 Annual Travel Credit</strong></h3><p>Every year, the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® gives me a travel credit that applies to the first $300 I spend on subways, taxis, ridesharing, and parking, as well as hotels, airfare, and cruises. The statement credit automatically appears next to any eligible transaction I pay with this card.</p><h3><strong>DoorDash Food Delivery</strong></h3><p>The Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® offers cardholders complimentary DashPass membership for waived delivery fees on qualifying orders. I&#39;ll have this benefit through December 31, 2027, and I had to enroll through my Chase account dashboard to receive this benefit.</p><p>As of summer 2024, my card now includes a $5 monthly DoorDash credit that works on restaurant orders. These credits expire every three months, so I can accumulate up to $15 in credit before I redeem them (or they expire).</p><p>I also get two monthly $10 DoorDash credits for grocery or convenience store orders that can&#39;t be used at restaurants. In most cases, the added cost of delivery and service fees negates the $10 savings, but I&#39;ve occasionally ordered green juice for pickup from my local 7-Eleven to use up the credit.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Priority Pass Airport Lounge Access</strong></h3><p>Having access to airport lounges is one of my favorite perks of the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®. Lounges are comfortable, relaxing, and exclusive areas where you can enjoy comfortable seats, an internet connection, food and drinks &mdash; often complimentary &mdash; and other amenities on occasion.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® is the original card that helped me <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/how-to-get-priority-pass-for-free">get Priority Pass for free</a>. My <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/credit-cards-with-airport-lounge-access">Priority Pass Select membership</a> lets me bring two guests with me to any lounge &mdash; a fringe benefit that&#39;s fantastic for families or couples.&nbsp;</p><p>This benefit far less useful than I did several years ago, because I now have three credit cards that come with Priority Pass access. While I still find the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® very valuable, it feels extravagant to triple-pay for a pricy benefit I can only use once at a time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you want to share Priority Pass access with family members who don&#39;t travel with you, check out my <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/capital-one-venture-x-rewards-credit-card-review">Capital One Venture X Rewards credit card review</a> to see how I juice five airport lounge memberships out of a single premium credit card. And if you aren&#39;t sure which card to get, read our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/capital-one-venture-x-vs-chase-sapphire-reserve-credit-card-comparison">comparison of the Capital One Venture X and Chase Sapphire Reserve</a> credit cards.</p><h3>Chase Sapphire Lounges</h3><p>In 2022, Chase began launching a proprietary portfolio of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-sapphire-lounge" rel="noopener">Chase Sapphire Lounges</a> in airports worldwide that are available to Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® cardholders and all Priority Pass members.&nbsp;</p><h4>Chase Sapphire Terrace</h4><p>My home airport, Austin, has a Chase Sapphire Terrace &mdash; a unique little space you won&#39;t find anywhere else in the world. This location is only available to Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® cardholders; Priority Pass members can&#39;t enter.&nbsp;</p><p>This sliver of indoor/outdoor space is exclusive to Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® cardholders, and only offers to-go snacks, Farmer&#39;s Fridge vending machine meals like salads, pastas, and sandwiches, and canned beverages (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). There&#39;s a single-stall bathroom on the outdoor patio, eight indoor seats, and an open-air patio space overlooking the Delta end of the tarmac.</p><p>The space isn&#39;t particularly luxurious or reflective of the other Chase Sapphire Lounges, but we have some of the sweetest staff members I&#39;ve ever met. There aren&#39;t any outlets, but you can ask the check-in desk for a portable charger to juice up your devices before travel.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Global Entry, TSA PreCheck, or NEXUS Application Fee Credit</strong></h3><p>The Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® offers a statement credit of up to $120 for Global Entry, TSA PreCheck, or NEXUS enrollment. This benefit is available once every four years, and membership in any of these programs is valid for up to five years &mdash; so if you keep this card open, you&#39;ll always have a credit available when you need to renew your membership.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to this credit card, I have both <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-global-entry-tsa-precheck-credit-card" rel="noopener">TSA PreCheckÂ® and Global Entry</a>, which includes TSA PreCheck enrollment.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Access to Chase Travel and The Edit by Chase Travel</strong></h3><p>Award travel aficionados have mixed reviews when it comes to booking travel through your credit card company. In many cases, I get the best rates and customer service by booking travel directly through the airline or hotel chain. But from time to time, I use the Chase Travel portal when I don&#39;t want to spend any money out of pocket.</p><p>Chase Travel works just like any other online travel agency (OTA) &mdash; and when I pay with my Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® but use points at checkout, I get a 50% bonus, where each point is worth 1.5 cents instead of the standard 1 point apiece. I typically book travel through Chase Travel when I need to book a direct domestic flight in cash, but don&#39;t want to pay for it out of pocket.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® Frequently Asked Questions">Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3 class="faq-question">What credit score do you need to get the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®?</h3><p class="faq-answer">You&#39;ll need a credit score of at least 670 to get the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®.&nbsp;Most people who are approved for the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® have a credit score in the good&nbsp;to&nbsp;excellent range, meaning a FICO score of at least 670. You&nbsp;need a credit score above 700 to open most travel credit cards.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Is the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® card worth it?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® is worth it if you&#39;re a frequent traveler who will maximize the card&#39;s credits and benefits. A frequent traveler can easily save $1,000 per year with the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®. But if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be able to use these benefits, you&#39;ll likely do better with the Chase Sapphire PreferredÂ® Card.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Who is the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® good for?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® is good for frequent travelers who can make the most of its benefits, especially the annual travel credit and airport lounge access. If you won&#39;t book paid travel through Chase and don&#39;t travel through airports with Priority Pass lounges, you might want to consider a different, less expensive, travel card.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Is the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® hard to get?&nbsp;</h3><p class="faq-answer">The Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® is only hard to get if you meet the following criteria: You have opened five or more cards in the past 24 months from any bank (excluding most small-business credit cards), known as the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/what-is-chase-524-rule" rel="noopener">Chase 5/24 rule;</a> you currently hold any flavor of Chase Sapphire card; or your credit score is below 670. You won&#39;t be eligible for its bonus if you&#39;ve received a Sapphire bonus within the past 48 months.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How do I add an authorized user to my Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®?</h3><p class="faq-answer">You can add an authorized user to your Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® through your online account. There&#39;s a $75 fee for each authorized user, but they&#39;ll get their own Priority Pass Select membership and get access to travel insurance and other benefits when they use their card.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Me: How I Reviewed the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®">Why You Should Trust Me: How I Reviewed the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®</h2><p>I&#39;ve been writing about credit cards for nearly a decade at this point, and have held premium and entry-level credit cards for many years before that.</p><p>I reviewed the Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ® by comparing it against similar premium credit cards, and assessed its merits based on the following factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of use &mdash;</strong> Is the card&#39;s rewards earning and redeeming easy to understand, even for beginners? Are there multiple options for using rewards?</li><li><strong>Potential rewards &mdash;</strong> Does the card offer a generous welcome bonus compared to competing cards, and does it offer bonus categories that are useful to the average traveler? Are any of the categories capped?</li><li><strong>Annual fee vs. value &mdash;</strong> Premium cards usually come with high annual fees. Is the fee justified by the rewards and perks the card offers?</li><li><strong>Benefits &mdash;</strong> Are the card&#39;s benefits, especially related to travel and upscale perks, at least equal to or better than similar cards?</li></ul><p>Here&#39;s a guide to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/how-we-rate-credit-cards" rel="" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="100" data-uri="f29426e4a1584ac8e22e14db6bc9b9b8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">how we rate credit cards</a> at Business Insider for closer look at our methodology.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-sapphire-reserve-credit-card-review">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>BankAmericard Secured Credit Card Review 2024: Is It the Best Secured Card for You?</title>
      <link>https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/bankamericard-secured-credit-card-review</link>
      <description>Our experts reviewed the BankAmericard Secured credit card&#39;s benefits, security features, and fees to help you decide if this card is right for you.</description>

See <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/how-we-rate-credit-cards" class="not-content-link" target="_blank">how we rate credit cards to write unbiased product reviews</a>.</p><p class="headline-regular financial-disclaimer non-affiliate-disclosure">The information for the following product(s) has been collected independently by Business Insider: BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card, Bank of AmericaÂ® Customized Cash Rewards Secured Credit Card. The details for these products have not been reviewed or provided by the issuer.</p><p>The BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card serves to establish or rebuild credit using a security deposit that you provide as your credit limit.</p><p>Business Insider experts compared this product to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-secured-credit-cards">best secured credit cards</a> and found it lacking in comparison because cardholders do not earn rewards, nor do they have the option of automatically upgrading to an unsecured card down the line.&nbsp;</p><h2>BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card Overview</h2><p>The BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card does not have an annual fee, which is a positive. Many secured cards charge you for the privilege of having them. But there&#39;s also no rewards program or welcome offer, a benefit competing secured cards increasingly feature.&nbsp;</p><p>Bank of America is one of the largest banks, so having a positive payment history on this card that gets reported to the three main credit bureaus can boost your credit score. However, other secured card options offer periodic account reviews and upgrades to unsecured cards, while this card doesn&#39;t guarantee either benefit.</p><p>This card&#39;s security deposit requirement is low, and the APR is on the higher side. Other secured cards offer rewards and a variety of credit limits, so shop around unless you&#39;re loyal to Bank of America: There are better <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-secured-credit-cards#best-for-no-credit-check">secured credit cards</a> available on the market.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card Benefits">BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card Rewards</h2><p>The BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card does not earn any rewards, nor does it come with a welcome offer, also known as a sign-up bonus.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card Benefits">BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card Key Features and Benefits</h2><p>The BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card offers a low security deposit and high APR. But we should also point out what the card doesn&#39;t offer: an automatic path to an unsecured credit card.&nbsp;</p><p>While Bank of America says it will &#34;periodically review your account&#34; to return your security deposit, the issuer doesn&#39;t provide a timeframe when you can expect those reviews, like Discover or Capital One. The issuer also makes no mention of a credit line increase, or potential to upgrade to an unsecured Bank of America card down the road. That&#39;s a huge missed opportunity for those hoping for an unsecured credit line or credit increase.</p><h3>Security and Credit Building</h3><p>The BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card will appear on your credit profile shortly after you open the card.</p><p>All of your activities on this card will impact your payment history, credit mix, and credit utilization. If you don&#39;t already have a credit card, consistent positive updates could be just what you need to turn your credit around.&nbsp;</p><p>Holding this card is also your chance to demonstrate that you can responsibly use your credit and make payments on time. You&#39;ll want to use 30% or less of your available credit, and 10% if you can help it, to maintain the best <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/credit-utilization-ratio">credit utilization ratio</a>. For 10% credit usage, that would mean spending $20 or less on a $200 credit line at any given time.&nbsp;</p><p>To start, you could put a subscription service or two on the BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card and set up autopay. That would be an easy way to send all the right credit signals: on-time payments, low utilization and regular usage.&nbsp;</p><h3>Free FICOÂ® Score</h3><p>A nice feature is free access to your FICO credit score, updated monthly when you opt in. That&#39;ll help you keep track of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/how-is-credit-score-calculated">your credit score</a>, and can offer encouragement as your credit behaviors start to reflect on your score.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mobile Wallet</h3><p>The BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card works with digital payment technology including <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-pay">Apple Pay</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-pay">Google Pay</a> and Samsung Pay.

Instead, you&#39;ll need to put down a higher security deposit to increase your credit line.&nbsp;</p><h3>Annual Fee</h3><p>The BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card has an annual fee of $0 &mdash; no cost to hold this card.</p><h3>APR Rates and Other Associated Fees</h3><p>Although this card&#39;s APR isn&#39;t as high as that of other secured cards, it&#39;s still pretty high. Because of this, you&#39;ll want to pay your card in full every billing cycle to avoid interest and avoid dinging your credit.</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Regular APR: 26.24% variable for purchases and balance transfers</li><li aria-level="1">Introductory APR: None</li><li aria-level="1">Balance transfer fee: 4%</li><li aria-level="1">Foreign transaction fee: 3%&nbsp;</li><li aria-level="1">Late payment penalty fee: Up to $40</li><li aria-level="1">Cash advance APR: 29.24%</li><li aria-level="1">Cash advance fee: 4%&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card Pros and Cons</h2><h3>Advantages of the BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card</h3><p>Having no annual fee is a plus, and so is gaining free access to your credit score on a monthly basis. However, these aren&#39;t revolutionary benefits any more.&nbsp;</p><p>Credit lines for this card go up to $5,000 with a security deposit of the same amount, which is a considerable sum of cash to tie up. If you plan to deposit that much money to get a secured credit card, you should consider alternative cards that offer better returns, such as the Bank of AmericaÂ® Customized Cash Rewards Secured Credit Card, reviewed below.</p><h3>Potential Drawbacks and Considerations of the BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card</h3><p>If you prefer a lower credit line, not earning any rewards won&#39;t be too meaningful. But if you want to put up a bigger security deposit, you can find other secured cards that will earn rewards and even include a welcome offer.&nbsp;</p><p>Not having a clear path to credit line increases or another of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-bank-of-america-credit-cards">Bank of America&#39;s unsecured cards</a> is a big downside&mdash;but if you just want a card to build some positive credit history and don&#39;t care about that, this one will do the trick.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who Should Get The BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card? Ideal Candidates</h2><p>If you&#39;re looking for a secured card to build your credit, but don&#39;t want to be drawn in by the allure of a rewards program, you can use the BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card to manage your spending without incurring an annual fee on the card.</p><h3>Best Usage Scenarios to Maximize Benefits</h3><p>Because the BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card is a secured card, you&#39;ll want to pay extra attention to your credit utilization ratio by making sure you keep your balance low.&nbsp;</p><p>For best success, you&#39;ll want to pay off the card in full whenever your balance starts to climb. The best way to do so is by charging a few small recurring charges, such as subscriptions on the card, and then paying off the full amount once the charges clear.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label=" BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card Customer Reviews">BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card&nbsp; Reviews and Ratings</h2><p>Our experts reviewed online forums such as Reddit and FlyerTalk to see what everyday consumers had to say about the BankAmericardÂ® Secured Credit Card.</p><p>Many people reported instant approval, even with late payments in the past.

<li>Title insurance protects a lender or homeowner if someone says they have a legal claim to your property.</li>
<li>While lender&#39;s title insurance protects your lender&#39;s interest in your property, it provides no protection to you as the homeowner.</li>
<li>To protect your own financial investment in your home, you&#39;ll need to buy a separate owner&#39;s title insurance policy.</li>
</ul><p>Just as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies">homeowners insurance</a> protects you financially if your home is physically damaged or destroyed, title insurance protects you if someone makes a claim against your property&#39;s title.</p><p>Title insurance is just one of the many protections you can have for your home &mdash; likely one of the largest purchases you&#39;ll make in your lifetime. Here&#39;s what to know about this insurance and how it will play into your home purchase journey.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Definition"><strong>Definition of title insurance</strong></h2><p>Title insurance protects a mortgage lender or homeowner from financial losses caused by issues with the home&#39;s title.</p><p>A home&#39;s title refers to who has ownership of or rights to the property. With title insurance in place, your insurer will defend you (and any co-owner) in court if another party tries to lay claim to your home. They will also cover damages and losses related to that claim.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Types of title insurance">Types of title insurance</h2><p>There are two types of title insurance: one for owners and one for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/best-mortgage-lenders">mortgage lenders</a>. Your mortgage company will require that you at least have lender&#39;s title insurance. This protects their financial interest in the home. Owner&#39;s title insurance is optional.</p><h3>Lender&#39;s title insurance</h3><p>If you&#39;re financing your home purchase, your lender will require that you buy a lender&#39;s title insurance policy. If someone tries to make a claim against your property&#39;s title, the insurance policy will compensate them for any losses. This includes if the claim is found valid and you&#39;re forced to give up your home to another party. (In this case, it would compensate them up to the total value of your home.)</p><h3>Owner&#39;s title insurance</h3><p>If you want to protect yourself, you&#39;ll need to purchase an owner&#39;s title insurance policy, which protects you against any title claims on your home.</p><p>Some of the most common title claims are related to unpaid taxes. If the homeowner before you has an unpaid <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/property-tax-by-state">property tax</a> bill and you don&#39;t have an owner&#39;s title insurance, you&#39;ll either need to pay the taxes out of your own pocket or risk losing your home. And if the previous owner failed to pay home contractors for their services, they may be able to make a title claim as well.</p><p>Having title insurance gives you financial protection should these issues crop up after you buy your house.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How it works">How title insurance works</h2><p>Here&#39;s what the title search and insurance process looks like from start to finish:&nbsp;</p><h3>The process of obtaining title insurance</h3><p>When you (or your lender) hire a title insurance company, they&#39;ll perform a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/title-search">title search</a> on your home. During their search, they&#39;ll look for any issues with the title that could stand in the way of the seller being able to transfer full ownership of the home into your name.&nbsp;</p><p>This process includes looking for outstanding liens on the property (i.e., essentially, unpaid debts that the property is being used as collateral for), unpaid property taxes, or other encumbrances. The title company will also establish a history of ownership and ensure that the seller is the current rightful owner of the home with the legal right to sell it.&nbsp;</p><p>If the title company uncovers any issues, some may be easy to fix. If so, they&#39;ll take the necessary steps to clear the title before you close on the home. Once the title has been cleared (or cured), the title company will issue a title insurance policy.&nbsp;</p><h3>What it covers and what it doesn&#39;t</h3><p>Title insurance covers claims related to unpaid taxes, unpaid contractor bills, and other liens against the property.&nbsp;</p><p>Title issues can also arise when public record errors, fraudulent documents, or undisclosed heirs or spouses are discovered. An owner&#39;s title insurance policy will protect you financially in all of these situations.</p><p>Be warned, though: Title insurance won&#39;t cover physical disputes of your property &mdash; like those relating to zoning, boundaries, or environmental hazards. Things like pest infestations or mold damage, which may be discovered after closing, aren&#39;t covered either.</p><h2 data-toc-label="The importance of title insurance">The importance of title insurance</h2><p>With average <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/home-prices-drop">home prices</a> over $400,000 in many places these days, you have a lot invested as a homeowner. Title insurance helps protect that investment and ensure you&#39;ll retain the rights to it (and its future sale proceeds) later on.&nbsp;</p><h3>Protecting against past discrepancies and legal issues</h3><p>The most important thing title insurance does is protect you and your lender against the mistakes of past owners &mdash; as well as many overlooked and unseen issues.&nbsp;</p><p>It ensures that if someone else makes a valid, legal claim to your property &mdash; maybe they&#39;re an heir of a past owner or they&#39;re owed a debt for past construction work on the house &mdash; you won&#39;t be out hundreds of thousands of dollars. Instead, the title insurance will compensate you for any losses that arise out of these situations.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ensuring peace of mind for homeowners and lenders</h3><p>Title insurance also just gives you and your lender peace of mind. There&#39;s no need to worry that a past contractor bill could come back to haunt you or that the previous owner&#39;s unpaid property taxes will cause you to lose your house. You can rest assured your financial investment is protected no matter what.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Common risks covered by title insurance">Common risks covered by title insurance</h2><p>Title insurance policies are intended to cover most issues that can arise surrounding your home&#39;s title. See below for details on what your policy can protect you from.&nbsp;</p><h3>Liens, encumbrances, and defects in title</h3><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/what-is-mortgage-lien">Liens</a> are claims to your property based on an unpaid debt. If a contractor was not paid by a previous owner, for example, they could place a lien against the property until they get paid back. The same goes for unpaid taxes, child support, and other court-ordered judgments.&nbsp;</p><p>It also covers encumbrances in the title that could impact how you use the property (or how others do). For example, there may be a utility easement on the home, allowing a local gas provider to install equipment on your property. If these encumbrances aren&#39;t found before your title policy is issued &mdash; and crop up later on after closing on the home &mdash; your insurance will compensate you for any losses.</p><p>General defects in the title, such as improperly filed or notarized documents, are covered by title insurance, too.</p><h3>Forgery and fraud</h3><p>Title insurance also protects you against fraud and forgery. This might include a forged deed, a fraudulent will giving someone claim to the property, or other instances of forgery or fraudulence.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Buying title insurance"><strong>The process of buying title insurance</strong></h2><p>The title insurance process isn&#39;t complicated. In fact, your lender and title company will do most of the heavy lifting. The only thing you&#39;ll need to do &mdash; in most cases &mdash; is pay for the policy as part of your closing costs.</p><h3>Title search and examination</h3><p>The initial process of getting title insurance involves the title search &mdash; when the title company uses public records, legal documents, tax liens, land records, deeds, court orders, and other documents to get a clear view of the property title&#39;s history. They&#39;re looking to uncover any discrepancies or potential alternate claims to the home.</p><p>If they find some, they will let the lender and borrower know, so they can get the issues resolved before closing. If a title contingency is in place, the borrower may be able to back out of the deal entirely.&nbsp;</p><h3>Closing the insurance policy</h3><p>You&#39;ll pay for your title insurance policy as part of your closing costs. Then, once you close on your mortgage loan and the sale has been recorded with your county, the title company will issue your title insurance policy.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Title insurance cost">How much does title insurance cost?</h2><p>A title insurance policy typically costs 0.5% of the home&#39;s price, according to the <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/rethinking-title-insurance-could-dramatically-lower-costs-homebuyers">Urban Institute</a>. This would be $2,000 on a $400,000 home.&nbsp;</p><p>The amount of coverage needed depends on who the policy is for. The lender&#39;s title insurance policy will cover the loan amount, while the owner&#39;s title insurance policy will typically be based on the property&#39;s sale price.</p><p>Unlike many other types of insurance, title insurance isn&#39;t an ongoing cost. You&#39;ll pay a one-time premium as part of your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/what-are-mortgage-closing-costs">closing costs</a>, and coverage will last for as long as you own the home. However, if you <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/when-to-refinance-mortgage">refinance</a>, you will likely need to purchase a new lender&#39;s title insurance policy.</p><h3>Who pays for title insurance?</h3><p>Who pays for title insurance often depends on what the real estate customs are in the area where the transaction is taking place. In some places, the custom is for the buyer to pay for the lender&#39;s policy and the seller pays for the owner&#39;s policy. In other areas, the buyer may cover both.</p><p>You can ask your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/how-to-find-real-estate-agent">real estate agent</a> what&#39;s typical where you live. You can also negotiate with the seller on who pays for what.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Should I buy title insurance?">Should I buy title insurance?</h2><p>If you&#39;re using a mortgage to purchase a home, you will be required to get a lender&#39;s title insurance policy. If you&#39;re buying a home using cash, you won&#39;t need title insurance.&nbsp;</p><p>But should you buy your own policy? In general, having an owner&#39;s title insurance policy is a good investment, since unexpected title claims can be expensive &mdash; at their worst, these claims could cost you the full value of your home.</p><p>If it&#39;s customary in your area for the seller to pay for an owner&#39;s title insurance policy, it&#39;s definitely worth taking advantage of. But it&#39;s something you should seriously consider even if the cost comes out of your own pocket.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">Title insurance FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">Do I need both types of title insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">While lender&#39;s title insurance is usually mandatory, an owner&#39;s title insurance policy is optional. Still, due to title insurance&#39;s role in protecting real estate investments, it&#39;s highly recommended you purchase both.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How much does title insurance cost?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The cost of title insurance varies by location, loan amount, and policy type but it is usually around 0.5% of the home&#39;s purchase price. It is a one-time fee paid at closing, and rates can range from a few hundred to a couple of thousand dollars.</p><h3 class="faq-question">Is title insurance a recurring expense?</h3><p class="faq-answer">No, title insurance is paid through a one-time premium at the time of closing and remains effective for as long as you own the property (or until you refinance.)</p><h3 class="faq-question">Can I shop around for title insurance?</h3><p class="faq-answer">Yes, you should compare prices and services from different title insurance companies to find the best rates and coverage. Ask your real estate agent if you need help choosing a title insurance policy.</p><h3 class="faq-question">What happens if a title defect is discovered after I&#39;ve bought the property?</h3><p class="faq-answer">There are many benefits of owner&#39;s title insurance policies, but the biggest are the financial and legal protection they provide. If you have owner&#39;s title insurance, the insurance company will manage the legal defense against claims and cover any financial losses up to the policy limit.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/what-is-title-insurance-protection-for-homeowners">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the expense to passengers can quickly add up to hundreds of extra dollars over the course of a single trip.<p class="copyright">Mongkol Chuewong/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><h2 data-toc-label="Intro">Introduction to Airline Baggage Fees</h2><h3 data-toc-label="Why Bag Fees Matter">Why Baggage Fees Matter</h3><p>Baggage fees have become a contentious part of air travel, as well as a bargaining chip for airlines to entice flyers into opening airline credit cards and earning elite status in loyalty programs by offering free checked bags.&nbsp;</p><h2>Major U.S. Airlines and Their Baggage Fees</h2><p>Some people avoid checking bags altogether, but sometimes it&#39;s a necessity&mdash;and airlines are counting on it. Baggage fees are a big part of operating revenue. For passengers, the cost can add up to hundreds of extra dollars, especially for families and groups. That could be meaningful enough to book with a competing airline or stay loyal to the same one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="American Airlines">American Airlines</h2><h3><strong>Fees for checked and carry-on baggage</strong></h3><p>American Airlines charges $40 for the first checked bag ($35 if you pay online) and $45 for the second when traveling with the U.S. (including Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands). For travel to or from Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and Guyana, the first checked bag costs $35 and $45 for a second bag.&nbsp;</p><p>Carry-on bags and a personal item are free on most routes, including for Basic Economy tickets.</p><h3><strong>Additional fees for overweight or oversized bags</strong></h3><p>Overweight bags between 50 and 53 pounds cost $30 for all routes. If your bag is between 53 and 70 pounds, you&#39;ll pay $100, except for flights to Cuba, where you&#39;ll pay $200. Bags over 70 pounds cost $200 within North America, the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), Central America and South America and $450 to China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, India and New Zealand. Bags over 70 pounds aren&#39;t accepted on flights to Europe, as well as to Cuba, Israel, Qatar or to/from Australia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Oversized bags from 62 to 65 inches cost $30 for all flights. A bag over 65 inches, but not to exceed 115 inches, costs $200 on most routes but $150 on flights to South America (excluding Guyana and Suriname), Panama, China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, India, Australia and New Zealand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Credit card recommendation</strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/citi-aadvantage-platinum-select-card-review">CitiÂ® / AAdvantageÂ® Platinum SelectÂ® World Elite MastercardÂ®</a> offers a free checked bag for you and up to four companions traveling on the same reservation.</p><p>You do not need to use your card to pay for the tickets, but you must add the primary card member&#39;s American Airlines loyalty number seven days prior to traveling.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Delta Airlines">Delta Airlines</h2><h3><strong>Fees for checked and carry-on baggage</strong></h3><p>Delta charges $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second. Note that baggage must not exceed 62 inches when you add length, width and height together.&nbsp;</p><p>One carry-on bag and one personal item are free.</p><h3><strong>Additional fees for overweight or oversized bags</strong></h3><p>Overweight bags vary based on destination. For bags over 50 pounds and up to 70 pounds, you&#39;ll pay $100 on all flights, except those between North America and San Pedro Sula, Honduras and San Salvador, El Savador. Bags between 70 and 100 pounds cost $200, except for routes where bags over 70 pounds are not permitted, including:&nbsp;</p><ul><li aria-level="1">Between North, South and Central America, Europe and North Africa</li><li aria-level="1">Between or through Europe, South Africa or United Arab Emirates</li><li aria-level="1">Between or within Australia and New Zealand</li></ul><p>Bags over 100 pounds are not allowed at all.&nbsp;</p><p>For oversized bags between 63 and 80 inches on any side, you&#39;ll pay:</p><ul><li aria-level="1">$100 to or from Brazil</li><li aria-level="1">$150 between the U.S. and Canada to Central America, South America, the Caribbean or Mexico</li><li aria-level="1">$175 to or from the Middle East, Africa (excluding North Africa), Asia, India or Australia</li><li aria-level="1">$200 between or within the U.S. and Canada (including domestic flights)</li><li aria-level="1">$300 between North, Central and South America, Europe and North Africa&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Bags over 80 inches are not permitted on any flight.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Credit card recommendation</strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/gold-delta-skymiles-amex-card-review">Delta SkyMilesÂ® Gold American Express Card</a> offers a free first checked bag for the cardholder and up to eight companions on the same reservation.</p><p>You don&#39;t need to use the card to pay for the flights. This is one of the most generous free-bag policies, and can add up to meaningful savings if you need to use it.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="United Airlines">United Airlines</h2><h3><strong>Fees for checked and carry-on baggage</strong></h3><p>United charges $40 for the first checked bag ($35 if you prepay online) and $50 for the second ($45 if prepaid) on many routes. If you&#39;re flying to or from Europe, South America, Africa, Asia or Australia, your first checked bag is free and the second costs $100.&nbsp;</p><p>Carry-on bags are free except for Basic Economy, where you&#39;ll pay the standard baggage fee plus an additional $25 if you check it at the gate. The exceptions are flights to South America, as well as transatlantic and transpacific flights, which allow a carry-on bag.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Additional fees for overweight or oversized bags</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Overweight bags cost $100 if they&#39;re 51 to 70 pounds and $200 between 71 and 100 pounds. Exceptions apply, which are based on the exact route. For example, for flights to or from Europe, you&#39;ll pay $200 (instead of $100) for a bag weighing 51 to 70 pounds.</p><p>Fortunately, United has a <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us/checked-bag-fee-calculator/any-flights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baggage calculator</a> that will show you exact prices for oversized and overweight bags for your flight, as well as which special items are permitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Bags over 100 pounds are not allowed on any United flights.

You must use the card to pay for United flights to get the benefit.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Southwest Airlines">Southwest Airlines</h2><h3><strong>Fees for checked and carry-on baggage</strong></h3><p>Southwest allows two free checked bags per passenger, each up to 50 pounds and 62 inches in size (length + width + height).

Blue Plus fares and JetBlue Plus cardmembers get a first checked bag for free. Mint fares and Mosaic elite members get two bags checked for free.&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;ll pay $10 more within 24 hours of departure (and the free bags are still free). For peak pricing, you&#39;ll pay $40 for the first bag and $60 for the second &ndash; and add $10 more within 24 hours of departure.&nbsp;</p><p>To make it even more fun, transatlantic flights have different prices. The first bag costs $60 and the second is $100 for Blue Basic fares. Blue, Blue Plus and Blue Extra fares and JetBlue Plus cardmembers get a first bag checked free. Mint fares and Mosaic members, again, get two free checked bags. Add $5 for the first bag if you pay within 24 hours of departure and another $5 for peak times. Add $10 for the second bag during peak times, if it&#39;s not included with your fare or status.&nbsp;</p><p>Carry-on bags are free for all customers.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Additional fees for overweight or oversized bags</strong></h3><p>Overweight bags between 51 and 99 pounds cost $150 each and oversized bags between 63 and 80 inches are $150 each. Note that bags cannot exceed 70 pounds for transatlantic flights.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Credit card recommendation</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/jetblue-plus-credit-card-review">JetBlue Plus Card</a> offers a free first checked bag for the cardholder and up to three companions on the same reservation when you use your card to purchase JetBlue tickets.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Alaska Airlines">Alaska Airlines</h2><h3><strong>Fees for checked and carry-on baggage</strong></h3><p>Alaska Airlines charges $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second. Carry-on bags are free.</p><p>If you&#39;re flying home from one of 32 airports in California, Idaho, Oregon or Washington, you can also check a box or case of wine, containing up to 12 bottles and weighing up to 50 pounds, for free.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Additional fees for overweight or oversized bags</strong></h3><p>Overweight bags from 51 to 100 pounds cost $100, and oversized bags from 63 to 115 linear inches are $150 each. Anything over 100 pounds or 115 inches is not permitted, though musical instruments are an exception.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Credit card recommendation</strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/alaska-airlines-credit-card-review">Alaska Airlines Visa SignatureÂ® credit card</a> offers a free first checked bag for you and up to six companions when you purchase airfare with your card.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Spirit Airlines">Spirit Airlines</h2><h3><strong>Fees for checked and carry-on baggage</strong></h3><p>Spirit charges varying fees for checked bags and carry-on bags. You&#39;ll pay a different price if you pay for a checked bag during booking, before or during online check-in, at the airport or at the gate. Prices start at $50 for paying when you book, $65 for a first checked bag before or during checking in online and $79 at the airport or boarding gate.&nbsp;</p><p>The best way to determine the price for your checked bag is to use Spirit&#39;s <a href="https://www.spirit.com/optional-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online calculator</a>. Enter your departure airport, destination airport and dates of travel to see a complete breakdown of baggage fees.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Additional fees for overweight or oversized bags</strong></h3><p>Overweight bags from 51 to 100 pounds cost $125 per bag and oversized bags between 63 and 80 linear inches cost $150 each.</p><h3><strong>Credit card recommendation</strong></h3><p>The Free SpiritÂ® Travel More World Elite MastercardÂ® provides points, but does not include free checked bags. Instead, consider using the $300 annual travel credit from the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-sapphire-reserve-credit-card-review">Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®</a> or the $200 annual incidental fee credit from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/american-express-platinum-credit-card-review">The Platinum CardÂ® from American Express</a> to cover the cost of checked bags on this airline.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Frontier Airlines">Frontier Airlines</h2><h3><strong>Fees for checked and carry-on baggage</strong></h3><p>Frontier charges $60 to $79 for carry-on and checked bags, depending where in the process you pay for it. The best way to check is with Frontier&#39;s <a href="https://www.flyfrontier.com/optional-services?mobile=true#bag-prices-for-new-trip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online bag price calculator</a>.</p><p>Frontier charges for a carry-on bag, which must be 35 pounds or less, and for checked bags, which must be 40 pounds or under.&nbsp;</p><p>Frontier expressly says it doesn&#39;t guarantee any of its pricing until the point of purchase.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Additional fees for overweight or oversized bags</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Bags between 41 and 50 pounds cost $75, while bags from 51 to 100 pounds cost $100. Oversized bags from 53 to 110 linear inches cost $75 each.</p><p>Bags over 100 pounds or 110 linear inches are not accepted. Assistive devices are excepted from these rules.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Credit card recommendation</strong></h3><p>The Frontier Airlines World MastercardÂ® offers two free checked bags for the primary cardmember who uses the card to book and pay directly with Frontier.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to Reduce or Avoid Fees">Strategies to Reduce or Avoid Baggage Fees</h2><h3>Use credit card benefits if you fly multiple airlines throughout the year</h3><p>Many <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-travel-rewards-credit-cards">travel credit cards</a> offer reimbursements for incidental expenses, including baggage fees, across multiple airlines.</p><p>Premium cards like the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/chase-sapphire-reserve-credit-card-review">Chase Sapphire ReserveÂ®</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/american-express-platinum-credit-card-review">The Platinum CardÂ® from American Express</a> offer <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/things-to-do-new-amex-platinum-card">annual travel credits</a> that can be used for baggage fees.&nbsp;</p><h3>Loyalty programs and elite status</h3><p>Airline loyalty programs often include waived baggage fees for members. By joining these programs, you&#39;ll earn miles that count toward elite status.&nbsp;</p><p>Once achieved, airlines typically let you check your first (and sometimes second) bag for free, including with partner airlines. This benefit can significantly reduce travel costs, especially if you frequently fly with the same airline.</p><h3>Packing tips to minimize fees</h3><p>The way you pack can help you avoid or reduce baggage fees. Use <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/packing-cubes-essential-for-travel-2022-8">packing cubes</a> to maximize space and consider rolling your clothes instead of folding them to fit more into your carry-on. Seriously, try it. Once you do, it&#39;s a game-changer.&nbsp;</p><p>Opt for a carry-on bag whenever possible, as most airlines allow at least one free carry-on bag. This can save you money on checked baggage fees, particularly for short trips. Personally, I can live for up to a week out of a well-packed carry-on.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;re going to buy new gear for a trip, especially domestically, consider having it delivered to your hotel when you arrive.&nbsp;For example, we stowed enough diapers for our infant to last us a couple of days during a recent domestic trip. On the third day, we had a box of diapers delivered to our hotel&#39;s front desk, significantly reducing our total luggage volume. You can also do this with other consumables that don&#39;t necessarily have to go back home with you.&nbsp;</p><h3>Additional tips and tricks</h3><p>Make the most of airline partnerships and alliances to take advantage of more lenient baggage policies. If you&#39;re flying on a codeshare flight, check the baggage policies of both airlines to see which offers better terms. The baggage policy is always listed as part of the booking process.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, if you have status within an alliance, sticking to other airlines within the same alliance can get you free checked bags and perhaps a few other perks, like priority boarding and free seat selection.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, always review baggage policies before booking, because certain airlines offer discounts on baggage fees when you pay in advance. This can help you avoid fees at the airport, especially if you know you&#39;re going to check a bag.</p><h2>Major Airline Policies Overview</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p><strong>Domestic checked bag fee</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Carry-on bag fee</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Fee for overweight bags</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Fee for oversized bags</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Credit card recommendation</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>American Airlines</strong></p></td><td><p>$35 (online) / $40 (airport) for first checked bag, $45 for second</p></td><td><p>Free for one personal item and one carry-on</p></td><td><p>$30 for bags 50 -

You should also shop around to compare quotes from multiple insurers. Opting for an annual plan if you&#39;re a frequent traveler, checking existing coverages from other insurance policies or credit card benefits, and choosing a policy with a higher deductible can significantly lower your premiums. Always read the fine print to understand your coverage fully, ensuring you don&#39;t pay for redundant or irrelevant features.</p><h3 class="faq-question"><strong>Where are the cheapest places to buy travel insurance?</strong></h3><p class="faq-answer">To find affordable travel insurance, consider using online comparison websites like SquareMouth or InsureMyTrip to see rates from various providers. Other ways to save include purchasing directly from insurance companies, exploring package deals from travel agencies or airlines, utilizing included coverage from credit card benefits, and checking for discounts through membership organizations such as AAA or AARP.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/travel-insurance/average-weekly-travel-insurance-rates">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li>The best way to determine how much house you can afford is by working backward from your current budget.</li>
<li>Look at how much you spend each month and see how a mortgage payment could fit into that.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t forget about other costs like property taxes, insurance, home maintenance, and repairs.</li>
</ul><p>Figuring out how much house you can afford isn&#39;t always as straightforward as it seems. Between <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/mortgage-preapproval">mortgage preapprovals</a> and one-size-fits-all rules of thumb, it&#39;s easy for homebuyers to unwittingly overspend and end up with more house than their budgets can handle.&nbsp;</p><p>The best way to a homebuying budget is to take a personalized approach, looking at what your budget can realistically handle without sacrificing other wants, needs, and financial goals. Here&#39;s how you can do that.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Understanding your homebuying budget">Understanding your homebuying budget</h2><h3>Key factors that determine affordability</h3><p>How much house you can afford will be determined by:</p><ul><li><strong>Your income:</strong> The amount of money you have coming in every month will directly impact how much you can afford to spend on a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/average-mortgage-payment">mortgage payment</a>.</li><li><strong>Monthly expenses:</strong> Your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/best-mortgage-lenders">mortgage lender</a> will look at your debts when determining how much to approve you for, but you should also consider your other regular expenses, like food, utilities, savings, or entertainment.</li><li><strong>Current mortgage rates:</strong> The lower your mortgage rate, the more house you can afford. Even a small change in rates can impact the size of the mortgage you can borrow.</li><li><strong>Available savings: </strong>You&#39;ll typically need to make a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/how-much-down-payment-for-a-house">down payment when you buy a house</a> (unless you qualify for a zero-down mortgage like a VA loan). Making a larger down payment means you&#39;ll be borrowing less money, resulting in a lower mortgage payment. You&#39;ll also need to pay closing costs.</li><li><strong>Your creditworthiness:</strong> Lenders look at your credit history, debts, and assets to determine how risky a borrower you are. If you have a strong financial profile, you may be able to borrow more money or get a lower interest rate.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Where you live can impact home affordability</h3><p>How much house you can afford depends a lot on where you live. For example, in our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/cost-of-living-comparison-buy-rent">cost of living comparison</a>, Business Insider found a wide variation in median mortgage payments across the country. West Virginia has the lowest median monthly payment of $1,208, according to U.S. Census data. By contrast, Washington, D.C. has the highest, with a median payment of $3,001.</p><p>If you buy in a popular city or metro area, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/home-prices-drop">home prices</a> are likely to be higher, resulting in a larger monthly payment. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/state-mortgage-rates">Mortgage rates also vary by state</a>, so you could pay more to borrow if you live in a place with a higher cost of living. If your area has high property taxes or homeowners insurance rates, that will raise your costs, too.</p><p>The neighborhood you choose to live in can also impact affordability. Some communities have homeowners associations, which come with regular HOA dues.</p><h3>The 28/36 rule in homebuying</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/28-36-rule-mortgages">28/36 rule</a> is a popular guideline that can help homebuyers figure out how much house they can afford. To follow this rule, homebuyers should aim to spend no more than 28% of their gross monthly income on housing costs, and a maximum of 36% of their income on all their debts combined (including housing costs).</p><p>This rule can get you in the ballpark of what a reasonable homebuying budget might look like, but try to avoid relying solely on rules of thumb like this.&nbsp;</p><p>Brian Walsh, CFP and head of advice and planning at <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/sofi-mortgage-review">SoFi</a>, says that guidelines like this don&#39;t account for different budget needs or levels of debt. He also warns that they can tempt you to overspend.</p><p>&#34;I think those can be helpful to set context, but the problem is no two people are the same,&#34; Walsh says.</p><h3>Calculating your debt-to-income ratio (DTI)</h3><p>A lender will look at your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/debt-to-income-ratio">debt-to-income ratio</a> when determining how much you can afford to borrow. Your DTI measures how much you pay each month toward debts you owe relative to your gross monthly income. So, if you spend $500 a month on credit card and auto loan payments and your monthly pre-tax income is $2,000, your DTI is 25%.&nbsp;</p><p>On a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/conventional-mortgage">conventional mortgage</a>, the maximum DTI you can have varies depending on your situation and lender, but 50% is generally the highest acceptable ratio. However, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that a mortgage fits into your budget as long as your DTI doesn&#39;t exceed that threshold. Follow the steps below to set a budget that considers your full financial picture, not just your debts.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="How to calculate how much house you can afford">How to calculate how much house you can afford</h2><h3>Step 1: Assess your monthly income</h3><p>First, you need to know how much money you&#39;re working with. If you have a single source of steady income, this should be relatively easy.&nbsp;</p><p>If your income varies from month to month, try to establish a baseline for what your earnings typically look like (but be sure to have a plan for how you&#39;ll pay your mortgage if you have a month where you earn less than expected). Also, pay attention to how your income has trended over the last few years and whether you think it&#39;s likely to increase, decrease, or remain steady. This can help you evaluate how likely it is that you&#39;ll be able to keep up with your mortgage payments in the future.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 2: Evaluate your monthly expenses</h3><p>Take a holistic look at your current budget and see how a mortgage payment could fit into that.</p><p>&#34;What we encourage people to do is really start with their budget and work backwards,&#34; Walsh says.</p><p>This means looking at what you&#39;re currently spending on housing and how that fits in with your other expenses, including household needs, retirement and other savings, debt payments, childcare costs, and everything else.</p><p>At the end of the month, do you have money left over? Or are you frequently tapping savings or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/best-credit-cards">credit cards</a> to cover regular costs? If your budget is already stretched tight, becoming a homeowner is likely to exacerbate that.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 3: Factor in down payment savings and assistance</h3><p>The more money you put down, the less you have to borrow, resulting in a smaller monthly payment. Making a big down payment can help you snag a lower interest rate as well, which also can make your mortgage payment more affordable.</p><p>If you don&#39;t have a lot of money saved for a down payment, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you can&#39;t afford to buy a house. It&#39;s possible to get a conventional mortgage with a down payment of just 3%. And if you qualify for a VA or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/usda-loan">USDA loan</a>, you might not need to make a down payment at all. You may also be able to get <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/down-payment-assistance">down payment assistance</a> to help you get into a home.</p><p>On top of your down payment, you&#39;ll need to pay closing costs, which can cost between 2% and 5% of the loan amount.</p><h3>Step 4: Consider mortgage interest rates</h3><p>When <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/average-mortgage-interest-rate">mortgage rates</a> are low, your buying power is increased. Say you&#39;re looking to spend no more than $2,000 on a monthly mortgage payment. If current <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/30-year-mortgage-rates">30-year mortgage rates</a> are hovering around 7%, you could borrow a mortgage of around $300,000. But if rates drop to 6%, you could borrow almost $35,000 more and keep that same monthly payment.</p><p>No matter how rates are currently trending, shopping around can help ensure you get the best overall deal. Rates can vary quite a bit from lender to lender, so getting quotes from at least three different mortgage lenders can save you a lot of money in the long term.</p><p>&#34;Small differences in the loan that you secure, whether it be interest rate, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/what-are-mortgage-closing-costs">closing costs</a>, origination fees, different things like that, they can really, really add up to big numbers,&#34; Walsh says.</p><aside class="quick-tip headline-regular ignore-typography"></aside><h3>Step 5: Figure out your other costs</h3><p>When you have a mortgage, you won&#39;t just be responsible for paying the principal and interest each month. Your mortgage payment will also include property taxes, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/best-homeowners-insurance-companies">homeowners insurance</a>, and mortgage insurance (if applicable). If you live in a community with a homeowners association, you&#39;ll need to factor in that cost as well.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/property-tax-by-state"><strong>Property tax</strong></a>&nbsp;rates are set by local governments, so how much you&#39;ll pay each month depends on exactly where you plan to buy and the value of the home. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median property tax paid in Alabama is $718, which would add less than $60 a month to your mortgage payment. But in New Jersey, it&#39;s $8,897, which would cost around $740 a month.&nbsp;</li><li>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/homeowners-insurance/average-homeowners-insurance-cost"><strong>average cost of homeowners insurance</strong></a> also varies depending on where you&#39;re located and your home&#39;s value. In 2021, the average homeowners insurance premium was $1,411, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. This would add just under $120 a month to your mortgage payment.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/pmi-private-mortgage-insurance"><strong>Mortgage insurance</strong></a> will be added to your monthly payment if you make a down payment that&#39;s less than 20% on a conventional loan. Freddie Mac says this can cost between $30 and $70 for every $100,000 you borrow.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>HOA dues</strong> can range from $200 a month to thousands of dollars a month, depending on the HOA&#39;s budget and the amenities it offers.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Using a mortgage calculator to find out how much you can afford</h3><p>Our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/mortgage-calculator">simple mortgage calculator</a> can help you get an idea of how much house you can afford. Plug in the typical home price in your area, how much money you have for a down payment, and an estimate of your mortgage rate to see how much that house could cost you on a monthly basis.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Tools and resources">Tools and resources to help you calculate affordability</h2><h3>Home affordability calculators</h3><p>Home affordability calculators can help give you an idea of what a good budget range might be for you, but keep in mind that many of these calculators rely on that same one-size-fits-all approach that can miss out on the intricacies of your individual budget.</p><h3>Consulting with a financial advisor</h3><p>Don&#39;t be afraid to seek out a professional opinion if you feel like you&#39;re in over your head. Working with a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/investing/best-online-financial-advisors">financial advisor</a> can help you ensure that you&#39;re balancing your budget appropriately as you prepare for homeownership.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Common mistakes">Common mistakes to avoid when determining affordability</h2><h3>Using preapproval to guide your budget</h3><p>A lot of first-time homebuyers might assume that it&#39;s safe to set your budget based on what the lender says you can afford. But that&#39;s often not the case.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;Most of the time what someone would get preapproved for is much more than what they should actually be spending on a home,&#34; Walsh says.</p><p>When a mortgage lender takes its initial look at your finances and decides it may be willing to lend to you, it will issue a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/mortgage-preapproval">mortgage preapproval</a> for a certain amount of money. Lenders determine how much they&#39;ll lend based on a borrower&#39;s DTI, but your actual budget likely includes a lot more than just your income and your debts. You&#39;ll also want to have money left over each month for groceries, to save, or to do fun things like go to the movies or take trips.&nbsp;</p><h3>Not starting off on strong financial footing</h3><p>&#34;You should always have a solid financial foundation before you consider buying a home,&#34; Walsh says.</p><p>This means you&#39;ll at least want to have an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/what-is-an-emergency-fund">emergency fund</a> with between three to six months of living expenses saved up. This should be separate from your down payment savings.</p><p>You should also consider paying down your debts before becoming a homeowner, especially if you have a lot of high-interest debt. Not only will this make qualifying for a mortgage easier, but it will also give you more room in your budget for your mortgage and other homeownership-related costs.</p><p>Make sure you&#39;re not neglecting your other financial goals. Having sufficient retirement savings, for example, is extremely important. If owning a home would cut into the amount you&#39;re able to save each month, you may need to rethink your budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Ignoring maintenance and hidden costs</h3><p>When you rent, the landlord takes care of a lot of your unexpected expenses. As an owner, you&#39;ll be on the hook for everything.&nbsp;</p><p>Be prepared to pay at least 1% of your home&#39;s value in maintenance and repair costs each year.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;If you don&#39;t plan for that, that can really be a silent budget killer where it comes up out of nowhere and you thought you were going to have spare money, but then now you don&#39;t,&#34; Walsh says.</p><h3>Assuming homeownership is always the best option</h3><p>You want to make sure you plan to stay in the home long enough to make buying a home worth it, Walsh advises. Though he says that homeownership can be beneficial for many people, it&#39;s not always the right choice for everyone.</p><p>&#34;The challenge is there&#39;s costs to both buying and selling a home,&#34; he says. &#34;So if you don&#39;t live in a home long enough to offset those costs, it can actually be a bad financial decision.&#34;</p><p>Experts often recommend not buying unless you plan to stay in a home for at least five years, but it can vary. Because home values usually rise over time, you&#39;ll gradually build equity in the home that can offset the costs you&#39;ll incur when you decide to sell. If you move too soon, you could end up spending more than you gained in home value.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="How first-time buyers can improve affordability">How first-time homebuyers can improve affordability</h2><p>First-time homebuyers often struggle the most with finding an affordable home. But there are some things you can do to make it easier.&nbsp;</p><h3>Work on your credit</h3><p>First, make sure your credit profile is strong. Paying down debt can <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/how-to-improve-credit-score">improve your credit score</a>, and it will also lower your DTI &mdash; two things that can help you get a better mortgage rate and lower your borrowing costs.</p><h3>Consider a cosigner</h3><p>If you can afford a monthly mortgage payment but are having trouble qualifying for a mortgage, you might have better luck getting someone to cosign the loan with you.&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure you both understand the risks of this, though. If you suddenly aren&#39;t able to pay the mortgage, the responsibility for the loan will fall to the cosigner.&nbsp;</p><h3>Shop around</h3><p>Don&#39;t go with the first lender that offers you a mortgage. Lenders all offer slightly different rates, and the only way to ensure you&#39;re getting the best rate available is to compare offers from a few different companies. Be sure to consider both rates and fees, since lender fees can impact how much cash you&#39;ll need to bring to the closing table.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/best-mortgage-lenders">best mortgage lenders</a> don&#39;t just offer low rates and fees. They also have other affordable features like low down payment loans or flexible credit requirements.&nbsp;</p><h3>Check out first-time homebuyer programs</h3><p>There are many opportunities for borrowers to get help with their home purchases thanks to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/best-mortgage-lenders-first-time-buyers">first-time homebuyer loans</a> and down payment assistance programs. A lot of mortgage lenders now offer assistance in the form of grants or loans that can give you the funds you need to get into a home. Your state&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/hfa-loan">housing finance agency</a> may also offer assistance.&nbsp;</p><h3>Explore different loan types</h3><p>The type of mortgage you get can also impact affordability. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/government-home-loans">Government-backed mortgages</a>, which include FHA, VA, and USDA loans, come with low or no down payment requirements and low rates compared to conventional mortgages.</p><p>If you have a good credit score and are looking to keep your down payment low, you might prefer a conventional loan, since they allow down payments of just 3%. But if you want access to the lowest conventional rates, you&#39;ll likely need to make a large down payment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Consider a different city or neighborhood</h3><p>If home prices are too high in your city, expanding your search area could help you find a more affordable home. You may find lower prices and more square footage just a few towns over. Ask your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/how-to-find-real-estate-agent">real estate agent</a> what areas near you are more affordable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Look at starter homes</h3><p>As a first-time buyer, you might not be able to afford as large a house as you initially envisioned. Your budget may limit you to starter homes, which are smaller and often have only one or two bedrooms. Then, as you gain equity in your home and grow your income, you may be able to afford a larger home later on.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="FAQs">How much house can I afford FAQs</h2><h3 class="faq-question">What percentage of my income should I spend on a house?</h3><p class="faq-answer">A common rule of thumb is to not spend more than 28% of your income on housing costs, but it&#39;s more reliable to look at your individual budget to see how much you can realistically afford.</p><h3 class="faq-question">How does debt affect how much house I can afford?</h3><p class="faq-answer">The more debt you have, the less house you&#39;ll be able to afford. Mortgage lenders decide how much you can borrow based on how much debt you owe relative to your income.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">What is a good down payment for a house?</h3><p class="faq-answer">With a 20% down payment, you&#39;ll avoid paying mortgage insurance, but you can qualify for a mortgage with as little as 3% down.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="faq-question">Can I afford a house if I have student loans?</h3><p class="faq-answer">It&#39;s possible that you can still afford a house even with student loans, it just depends on how much income you have left over after paying your loans.</p><div class="read-original">Read the original article on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/mortgages/how-much-house-can-i-afford">Business Insider</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

BrioDirect used to offer CDs, but it is no longer offering any at the moment. When reaching out to customer support, it also isn&#39;t clear whether CDs will be offered soon in the future.</p><h2 data-toc-label="About BrioDirect"><strong>About BrioDirect</strong></h2><p>BrioDirect is an online-only division of Webster Bank. You can currently open a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/5-percent-interest-savings-accounts">5% interest savings account</a> with BrioDirect.

BrioDirect&#39;s savings rate even stands out among other online banks, because not many financial institutions offer 5% APY.</p><p>The BrioDirect High-Yield Savings Account is great if you have at least $5,000 to open an account. It also has no monthly service fee.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label=" BrioDirect Alternatives"><strong>&nbsp;BrioDirect Alternatives</strong></h2><h3><strong>BrioDirect vs. CFG Bank</strong></h3><p>If you&#39;re looking for a place to grow your savings, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/cfg-bank-review">CFG Bank High Yield Money Market Account</a> is comparable to the BrioDirect High-Yield Savings Account. The money market account offers 5.00% APY and only requires a $1,000 minimum opening deposit.&nbsp;</p><p>CFG Bank also may be a better fit if you want to open other types of bank accounts. CFG Bank has money market accounts, checking accounts, and CDs that can be opened online from anywhere in the U.S., but you&#39;ll need to go to a branch in Baltimore, Maryland, to open one of the bank&#39;s standard savings accounts.</p><p>If you want to avoid monthly service fees though, the BrioDirect High-Yield Savings Account will likely be a better choice than the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/cfg-bank-review">CFG Bank High Yield Money Market Account</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/cfg-bank-review">CFG Bank High Yield Money Market Account</a> has a $10 monthly service fee unless you keep $1,000 or more in your account daily.

BrioDirect&#39;s savings account offers a slightly higher interest rate, but you&#39;ll need $5,000 to open an account.</p><p>If you don&#39;t have that much money to deposit upfront, you may prefer Jenius Bank&#39;s high-yield savings account.
